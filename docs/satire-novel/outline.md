## Thematic Arcs

**Jerry's Arc**: Cynical Survivor → Reluctant Helper → Active Participant → Believer → Mentor

**Susan's Arc**: Frustrated Idealist → Quiet Rebel → Movement Leader → Systems Designer → Visionary

**The Organization's Arc**: Dysfunctional Stasis → Crisis → Collapse → Rebuilding → Renewal

## Key Satirical Elements Throughout

- Meeting culture (every 10 chapters features a different ridiculous meeting)
- Email etiquette disasters (recurring theme)
- Jargon overload (escalates then deflates)
- Office supplies as status symbols (ongoing subplot)
- The eternal question: "What do we actually do here?"
- Recognition that some structure is necessary, but humanity is essential

## Message Arc

Early chapters: "This is absurd but we accept it"
Middle chapters: "This is absurd and we can't accept it"
Later chapters: "We can create something better"
Final chapters: "Imperfect progress is still progress"

The satire evolves from pure comedy to thoughtful commentary on finding meaning in work and the importance of human connection in increasingly depersonalized systems.
