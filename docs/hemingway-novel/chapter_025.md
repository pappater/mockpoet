# Chapter 25
The Unspoken Future

Frank sat at the bar. Tom walked in. He nodded to Frank. Frank nodded back.

"Evening, Frank," Tom said.

"Tom," Frank said.

Tom took the seat next to him. The bartender came over. A man with a clean white apron.

"Whiskey," Tom said. "The usual."

The bartender poured. He set the glass down. Tom took a sip.

"Good," Tom said.

"It is," Frank said.

They sat. The bar was not too crowded. A few men talked in low voices. A woman laughed by the door. She was alone. She wore a red dress.

Frank watched her. She laughed again. She caught his eye. He looked away.

"Long day," Tom said.

"They are," Frank said.

Tom finished his drink. He ordered another. Frank drank slowly.

"You finished the engine," Tom said.

Frank nodded. "It runs."

"Good," Tom said. He looked at his glass. "What now, Frank?"

Frank took a sip. The whiskey was warm in his throat. He set the glass down. It made a small sound on the wood.

"There is always something," Frank said.

Tom nodded. He looked at the bar. He traced a line on the polished surface with his finger.

"The stories are doing well," Tom said.

"They are good stories," Frank said.

"People read them," Tom said. "They want to know."

"Some do," Frank said.

He thought of Leo. Leo with his notebook. Leo with his questions. Leo with his understanding. Leo was seeing things now. He was writing.

"Leo is working hard," Tom said.

"He is," Frank said. "He sees things."

"He does," Tom said. "He has good eyes."

The woman in the red dress left the bar. The door swung shut behind her. The bell above it jingled. Frank watched the street through the glass. The light was fading. The buildings turned grey.

"The quiet," Tom said. "You found it out there."

"Some of it," Frank said.

"It does not last," Tom said.

"No," Frank said. "It does not."

He turned back to the bar. He looked at his empty glass. He pushed it forward slightly. The bartender came. He poured another. Frank did not ask for it. The bartender knew.

"She is in Paris," Tom said. He spoke without looking up.

Frank held the glass. He did not look at Tom. He looked at the whiskey. It was amber in the dim light.

"She always moves," Frank said.

"She does," Tom said. "Some people cannot stay."

"No," Frank said.

He thought of the cabin. The storm. Her words. "I can't stay." She had said it. He had known it. He knew it then. He knew it now.

The ache was still there. It was a familiar ache. It was like an old wound. It did not bleed. It did not hurt all the time. But it was there. Under the surface. A quiet hum. Like a distant engine.

He took a drink. The whiskey was good. It was steady.

"The war," Tom said. "It stays with you."

"It does," Frank said.

"You built the engine," Tom said. "That is something."

"It is," Frank said.

He thought of the planes at the airfield. The roar. The lift. The blue sky. He was on the ground now. His feet were on solid ground. The engine ran. That was enough.

"The search," Tom said. "It never really ends, does it?"

Frank looked at Tom. Tom looked back. His eyes were steady. His face was etched. They understood each other. They did not need many words.

"No," Frank said. "It does not."

He took another sip. The glass was cool in his hand.

"But the sun," Frank said. He looked out the window again. The sky was orange now. Then purple. Then dark blue. "The sun rises again, Tom."

Tom nodded. He looked out too. He saw the fading light. He saw the city lights come on. One by one.

"It always does," Tom said. He said it quietly.

Frank watched the sky. The city made a noise below. The streets were wet. A car horn sounded.

He felt the quiet acceptance. It was not peace. Not the kind of peace he once knew. Not the kind he had in the sky. But it was something. It was solid. It was enough for now.

He put down his glass. He stood.

"Good night, Tom," Frank said.

"Good night, Frank," Tom said.

Frank walked out. He felt the cold air. He walked down the street. The lights of the city were bright. The noise was loud. He walked through it. He walked toward his apartment. Toward the engine. Toward the quiet hum. The sun would rise again. He knew it.
