# Chapter 10
Arrival in Big Sky Country

The train slowed. Dust rose from the tracks. The air smelled of dry earth and pine. It was a different smell than the city. Frank watched it through the window. He could see the mountains now. They were far off. They stood blue and grey under the big sky.

The whistle blew. The train stopped. There was no bustle outside. No taxis honking. Just the hiss of the engine and the creak of the cars. Then a great silence.

"We're here," Tom said. He stood up. He reached for his bag.

Leo was already at the window. His face was pressed to the glass. "Look at it," he said. His voice was low. "It's enormous."

Eleanor put down her flask. She looked out. Her eyes narrowed against the bright light. "Enormous and empty," she said.

They stepped down onto the platform. The sun was high. It beat down on the small wooden station. There was one other man there. He stood beside an old truck. He wore a wide hat. He smoked a cigarette. He watched them get off.

Frank took a deep breath. The air was clean. It filled his lungs. He felt a quiet looseness in his shoulders. He looked at the mountains. He looked at the vastness of the sky. It stretched everywhere.

"This is it," Tom said. He nodded at the man with the truck. "Mr. Jensen?"

The man nodded. He tossed his cigarette butt into the dust. "You the fishing party?"

"That's us," Tom said. He gestured to Frank and Leo. "Tom Harris. This is Frank Miller, and Leo."

Mr. Jensen looked at them. His eyes were steady. They rested on Frank for a moment. Frank nodded back.

"And her?" Mr. Jensen asked. He looked at Eleanor. She stood a little apart. She pulled a silk scarf tighter around her neck.

"Eleanor Vance," Tom said. His voice was flat.

Eleanor gave Mr. Jensen a quick, hard smile. He didn't smile back.

"Cabin's about fifteen miles," Mr. Jensen said. "Upriver." He picked up their duffel bags. He put them in the back of the truck. His movements were slow. They were strong.

Leo looked around. There were no tall buildings. Only the small station. A general store across the tracks. A few other scattered houses. The rest was open land. Trees and hills. He wrote in his small notebook.

"What are you writing?" Eleanor asked him. Her voice was sharp.

Leo looked up. "Just notes," he said. "The silence. The scale of it."

"The silence is deafening," Eleanor said. She shivered. It was not cold.

Frank watched her. He said nothing. The sun was hot on his face.

"Let's go," Tom said. He climbed into the truck's cab.

Leo got in the back with the bags. He wanted to see everything. Frank sat beside him. He sat against the cab. Eleanor hesitated. She looked at the cab. She looked at the open back.

"You can sit up front," Tom called. "Plenty of room."

"No," Eleanor said. "I'll sit back here. Get some air." She climbed into the truck bed. She sat on her duffel bag. She lit a cigarette.

Mr. Jensen started the truck. The engine coughed. It settled into a low rumble. They pulled away from the station. Dust rose behind them. The small town disappeared quickly.

The road was dirt. It wound through open pasture. Fences ran alongside. They were old and grey. Trees began to line the road after a few miles. Pines. Cottonwoods. The river came into view sometimes. It was clear and fast. It cut a path through the land.

Leo pointed. "The river," he said. "It's so clear."

Frank nodded. He watched the water. He watched the way the sunlight hit it. It shimmered.

Eleanor leaned forward. "How far is this cabin?" she asked. Her voice was strained.

Mr. Jensen didn't look back. "Not far now," he said.

The truck bumped over ruts. Eleanor swayed. She took another drink from her flask. She put it away quickly.

"Are there any people out here?" she asked. Her eyes scanned the horizon. "A town? A general store?"

"Store back at the station," Tom called from the front. "That's it for miles. And a few ranches."

Eleanor leaned back. She stared up at the sky. It was too big for her.

Frank felt it was just right. He watched the pines. The light played through them. He thought of the woods back home. But this was different. Bigger. Older.

They drove for what felt like a long time. The cabin appeared suddenly. It sat nestled among the trees. Near the riverbank. It was made of dark logs. A stone chimney stood at one end. Smoke did not rise from it.

Mr. Jensen stopped the truck. He cut the engine. The sudden silence was immense. The only sound was the rush of the river.

"This is it," Mr. Jensen said.

Eleanor got down from the truck. She looked at the cabin. She looked at the river. Then she looked at the trees. They were everywhere.

"This is all there is?" she said. Her voice was thin. "A cabin?"

"It's a good cabin," Tom said. He got out. He stretched his legs. "Solid."

Frank got out. He walked to the edge of the river. He stood there for a moment. The water rushed by. He could smell it. Clean. Cold. He looked at the cabin. He felt a quiet hum inside him. A sense of being where he belonged. Or could belong.

"There's an outhouse behind," Mr. Jensen said. He pointed. "Water's from the river. Pump it clean. Good fishing right here."

Tom went to the truck. He started taking out the bags. Leo helped him. He was eager. He carried two duffels at once.

"It's rustic," Eleanor said. She walked slowly towards the cabin. Her heels sank into the soft earth. "Very rustic."

"It's a cabin," Frank said. He turned from the river. He walked towards the door.

He pushed the door open. The cabin was dark inside. It smelled of wood smoke and damp earth. There was a stone fireplace. A rough-hewn table. Four chairs. Two bunk beds along one wall. Another small bed in a corner. A lantern hung from the ceiling.

"No electricity," Eleanor said. It was not a question. It was a statement. Her voice held a note of accusation.

"No," Tom said. He brought in the first load of bags. He set them down. "That's the point."

Leo walked in. He looked around. His eyes widened. "It's simple," he said. "It's good."

"It's a place to sleep," Frank said. He walked to the window. He pushed it open. The clean air flowed in. The sound of the river grew louder.

Tom started to unpack the fishing rods. He laid them carefully on the table.

Eleanor stood in the middle of the room. She looked lost. "What do we do here?" she asked. "What do you do?"

Frank watched her. He looked out the window. The sun was getting low. It painted the sky with long streaks of red and gold. The mountains looked closer now. Darker. He turned back into the cabin.

"We breathe," Frank said. "We fish."
