# Chapter 22
The City's Pull Back

The train pulled into Grand Central. The air was thick. It smelled of coal smoke and too many people. Frank stepped down. Tom followed. Leo came behind. The platform was a roar. The noise closed in.

Frank carried his small bag. He did not look around. He walked. Tom walked beside him. Leo looked up at the high ceiling. He looked at the hurried faces. The city was a fast thing.

They took a taxi. The streets were crowded. Horns blew. People moved in waves. The buildings were tall. They cut the sky into small pieces. Frank looked out the window. The car moved slowly.

"It is loud," Leo said. He spoke almost to himself.

Tom grunted. "Always is."

Frank said nothing. He watched the streets. He saw the faces. They were hard faces. They were city faces.

The taxi stopped in the Village. Frank paid the driver. They stood on the sidewalk. Their bags were at their feet. The air was not clean. It was heavy. It smelled of exhaust and hot pavement.

"I will go home," Tom said. "Get some sleep. See about the manuscript in the morning."

"Good," Frank said.

"You, Leo?" Tom asked.

"I will walk," Leo said. "The city. I want to see it again."

Tom nodded. He took his bag. "See you, Frank."

"See you," Frank said.

Tom walked away. He walked with a purpose. He blended into the crowd. Leo stood for a moment. He looked at Frank.

"It is different," Leo said. "The quiet. The noise."

Frank looked at him. His eyes were flat. "It is."

"I will write," Leo said. He touched his pocket. His notebook was there.

"Good," Frank said.

Leo nodded. He turned. He walked down the street. He walked slowly. He looked at the shop windows. He looked at the people. He did not rush.

Frank picked up his bag. He walked to his apartment. The stairs were steep. The hall was dim. He opened his door. The room was small. It smelled of dust. He put his bag on the floor. He went to the window. The street was below. The noise came up to him. It was a familiar noise. It was not a good noise.

He looked at the engine parts on the workbench. They sat still. They waited. He looked at the goggles. They hung from a hook. He did not touch them.

He changed his shirt. He left the apartment. He walked to the speakeasy. The door was heavy. He went inside. The air was smoky. The light was low. The music was loud. It was jazz.

He sat at the bar. Tony, the bartender, saw him. Tony nodded. He poured a whiskey. He set it down.

"You are back," Tony said.

"Yes," Frank said. He picked up the glass. He drank. The whiskey was good. It was not Montana water. It was not the river.

"Long trip?" Tony asked.

"Long enough," Frank said.

Tony wiped the bar. He did not ask about El. He did not ask about anything else. He knew Frank. He knew how Frank was.

Frank drank another whiskey. The noise of the city seeped in. It filled the gaps. It did not fill them well. He thought about the river. He thought about the quiet. It had been a good quiet. It had been a different quiet.

He stayed for a long time. He drank. The whiskey warmed him. It did not make him warm inside. It just made him feel less cold. He left when the bar was closing. The street was empty. The city lights were on. They burned bright. They did not make the night less dark. He walked home. He slept without dreams. It was a shallow sleep.

The next morning, Tom was up early. He shaved. He ate his bread. He drank his coffee. He felt the city pulse. It was a quick pulse. He picked up his manuscript. He put it in a worn leather satchel.

He walked to the publisher's office. The building was stone. The door was heavy. He went inside. A woman at a desk looked up.

"Thomas Harris, for Mr. Sterling," Tom said.

"He is expecting you," she said. "Room 304."

Tom took the elevator. It was slow. It smelled of old paper. He found the room. He knocked.

"Come in," a voice said.

Tom opened the door. Mr. Sterling sat behind a large desk. He was a thin man. He had glasses. He did not smile.

"Mr. Harris," Sterling said. He gestured to a chair. "Sit down."

Tom sat. He put the satchel on his lap.

"You have a manuscript," Sterling said. It was not a question.

"Yes," Tom said. "Stories. From the war. From after."

Sterling nodded. He steepled his fingers. "The public. They do not want to read about the war. Not now. They want to forget."

"Some things," Tom said, "you cannot forget. Some things must be written."

Sterling looked at him. His eyes were sharp. "Sentiment. It does not sell. Is it good, Mr. Harris? Is it hard?"

"It is true," Tom said. "It is what I saw. What I know."

"Hmm," Sterling said. He held out his hand. "Let me see."

Tom took the manuscript from the satchel. He handed it over. Sterling took it. He did not look at the cover. He flipped through the pages. His face showed nothing.

"Leave it with me," Sterling said. "I will read it. I will call you."

"When?" Tom asked.

"When I have read it," Sterling said. "Do not call me."

Tom stood. "Thank you, Mr. Sterling."

Sterling just nodded. He was already looking at the first page.

Tom left the office. He walked down the street. The air was cold. His satchel was lighter. He felt a different kind of ache. It was not the ache of a wound. It was the ache of waiting. He walked towards Frank's apartment. He needed a drink.

---

Leo sat by his window. He watched the street. The city was a maze. It was a loud maze. He opened his notebook. He read what he had written in Montana. He read about Frank. He read about El. He read about Tom.

*The city was a loud beast. It swallowed you. It made you forget. But some things, they stayed. They stayed inside. Like the hum of an engine. Like the rush of a river. Like the quiet of a man who saw too much.*

He looked at his words. They felt different here. They felt real. They felt true. He had seen things. He had understood things. The city had seemed so clear before. Now it was full of shadows. It was full of things unsaid.

He took out a new page. He wrote: *The sun rose over the tall buildings. It did not warm the streets. It did not warm the people. They moved fast. They tried to outrun something. Maybe themselves.*

He looked up. The sun was high. It was a city sun. It was not a mountain sun. It was not a sun that showed you everything. It showed you only what was on the surface.

He heard a knock at his door. He opened it. It was Frank. Frank stood in the hallway. His face was neutral.

"You look different," Frank said.

"The quiet," Leo said. "It changed things."

Frank nodded. "It does."

"Come in," Leo said.

Frank stepped inside. He looked at Leo's notebook on the table. He did not ask.

"I have been walking," Leo said. "Thinking. Writing."

"Good," Frank said.

"The city," Leo said. "It feels... full. After the quiet."

"It is," Frank said. He looked out the window. "It fills you up. With its own noise."

"I saw Tom," Leo said. "He went to the publisher."

"Yes," Frank said. "He has his stories."

"And you?" Leo asked. "What will you do?"

Frank turned from the window. He looked at his hands. They were strong hands. They were pilot's hands. "I have my engine," he said. "It is still there."

"You will fix it?" Leo asked.

"I will work on it," Frank said. "It is what I have."

Leo nodded. He understood. It was a search. Everyone searched for something. Frank searched for the hum of an engine. Tom searched for words. El searched for speed. Leo searched for truth.

"I think I will go to the bar," Frank said. "Tom might be there."

"I will come with you," Leo said.

Frank nodded. They left the apartment. They walked down the stairs. The city waited for them. Its noise was a constant thing. It was a living thing. They walked in silence. The streets were busy. People pushed past them. The air was thick. It was not clean. It was the city. It was where they were. It was where they had to be. The sun was bright. It was a hard light. It shone on everything. It did not make anything clear.

They reached the speakeasy. The door was open. Music drifted out. It was a blues song. A sad, slow song. They went inside. Tom was already there. He sat at a small table. A whiskey was in front of him. He looked up. He saw Frank. He saw Leo. He gestured to the empty chairs.

"Another round, Tony," Tom said to the bartender. "My friends are back."

Tony nodded. He brought the glasses. He filled them. The whiskey smelled good. It smelled of home. It smelled of things that did not change.

Frank picked up his glass. He drank. The taste was familiar. It was a bitter taste. He looked at Tom. Tom's face was tired. His eyes were steady.

"Sterling," Tom said. "He took it."

"Good," Frank said.

"He said they do not want the war," Tom said. "Not now. They want to forget."

"They always forget," Frank said. He looked at the bottom of his glass. "Until it comes again."

Leo listened. He did not speak. He drank his whiskey slowly. It burned a little. It was a good burn. It made him feel something. He looked at Frank. He looked at Tom. Their faces were hard. They were city faces. But the quiet of the river, it was in their eyes. It was a memory. It was a promise. It was a ghost. The city did not drown it out. It only made it quieter. It made it harder to hear. But it was there. It was always there.
