# Chapter 2
El’s Entrance

The door opened. Another blast of noise hit the room. Frank watched it. He held his glass. He felt the cold on his fingers.

A woman came in. She was with a small group. She led them. Her hair was short. It was black. She wore a red dress. It was bright. She laughed. Her laugh was too loud for the door. It carried. Frank felt it.

Tom turned. He watched her too.

“Eleanor,” Tom said. He said it quietly.

Frank did not speak. He watched her. She moved fast. Her head turned. She saw the room. She looked for something. Or someone.

Her eyes found Frank. Across the crowded room. She stopped for a moment. Her laugh died. Just for a moment. Then it started again. Louder this time.

She said something to the man beside her. He smiled. He touched her arm. She pulled it away. Not hard. But he let go.

She started across the room. Her group followed. They were slow. She was fast. She moved like a current. The crowd parted.

Frank watched her come. He took a drink. The whiskey was good. It was smooth.

She reached their table. She stood. She looked at Frank. Her eyes were very blue. They were bright. Too bright.

“Still here, Miller?” she asked. She smiled. It was a wide smile.

“Still here, Vance,” Frank said. His voice was low.

She laughed again. It was a short laugh. A sharp sound.

“I thought you might have fled,” she said. “Gone back to the sky. Or the earth. Somewhere quiet.”

Frank looked at his glass. “Nowhere is quiet.”

“Don’t I know it,” she said. She looked around. Her eyes moved fast. She didn’t look at one thing for long. “Place is packed. Who are all these people?”

Tom cleared his throat. “Evening, El.”

She turned. She looked at Tom. Her smile softened. A little.

“Tom,” she said. “Always the steady one. Still watching over Frank?”

“Someone has to,” Tom said. He took a drink from his own glass.

She pulled up a chair. Another man from her group tried to stop her. He put a hand on her shoulder.

“Eleanor, darling,” he said. “We found a spot over there. By the bar.”

She shrugged him off. “This spot is better.” She sat down. Hard. The chair scraped the floor. “Go on, Geoffrey. Find your own fun.”

Geoffrey looked at Frank. Then at Tom. He sighed. He turned. He went back to her group. They looked disappointed.

Eleanor didn’t care. She lit a cigarette. Her movements were quick. Fluid. Smoke curled. It went up. It drifted.

“What are you drinking?” she asked Frank.

“Whiskey,” Frank said.

“Of course.” She waved a hand. A waiter appeared. He was fast. He knew her. “Whiskey for me, too, Jack. And one for my friend here.” She gestured to Tom. “Make it a double. And quick.”

The waiter nodded. He moved away.

She took a long drag from her cigarette. She blew smoke out. She leaned back. Her red dress shimmered.

“So,” she said. She looked at Frank. Her eyes narrowed. “What’s new, Miller? Still drawing your pictures?”

Frank shook his head. “Sometimes.”

“Of what? Airplanes? The ground rushing up?” She smiled. It was a teasing smile. But there was something else in it. Something hard.

Frank did not answer. He watched the smoke. It went up.

“Still the quiet one,” she said. “Some things never change.”

“Some things do,” Tom said.

She turned to Tom. “Oh, really? Like what, Tom? Tell me. I need to be impressed.”

Tom looked at her. “The war changed things.”

“The war changed everything,” she said. Her voice was sharp. “But it didn’t change Frank. Not really. He was always quiet. Always watching. Always thinking of things far away.”

“You knew him before,” Frank said. It was a statement. Not a question.

“I did,” she said. She looked back at him. “Seems like another life. Doesn’t it? Before the world broke.”

The waiter came back. He had the drinks. He put them down. Eleanor took hers. She drank it fast. A long swallow.

“Good,” she said. She put the glass down. It hit the table with a small sound. “I needed that.”

She lit another cigarette. From the stub of the first. Her fingers moved fast. Nervous.

“What’s the word from the front?” she asked. She was looking at Frank. But she was not seeing him. Her eyes were distant.

“There is no front,” Frank said.

She laughed. “Oh, Frank. Always so literal. I mean the front here. The city. Who’s doing what? Who’s still alive and kicking? Who’s trying to forget?”

“Everyone is trying to forget,” Tom said.

“And no one is succeeding,” Eleanor added. She looked around the room. Her eyes were still moving. “Look at them. All dancing. All laughing. All pretending it’s fine.”

“It is fine for some,” Frank said.

“No,” she said. She shook her head. Her hair bounced. “It’s not. Not really. It’s a performance. A show. We’re all actors. Trying to play the part of happy people.”

She looked at Frank again. “Are you happy, Frank?”

He picked up his glass. He drank. He put it down. “I am here.”

“That’s not an answer,” she said.

“It is my answer,” he said.

She sighed. A small sound. It was lost in the noise of the room.

“You’re impossible, Miller,” she said. “Always were.”

“You liked it once,” Frank said.

Her eyes met his. The blue was intense. For a moment. The smile left her face.

“Once,” she said. Her voice was quiet. “A long time ago. Everything was different then.”

She looked away. She picked up her glass. She drank again. Faster this time.

“Still flying dreams, Frank?” she asked. Her voice was lighter now. Too light.

Frank looked at her. “Sometimes.”

“Do you miss it?” she asked.

He paused. The noise of the speakeasy was a dull roar. The piano played something fast. A saxophone wailed.

“The air was clean,” Frank said. “Up there.”

“Down here it’s dirty,” she said. She took another drink. “Always. And the people are worse.”

Tom shifted in his chair. “Easy, El.”

“Oh, don’t start, Tom,” she said. She waved a hand. “I’m just speaking the truth. Someone has to. Or do we all just pretend?”

She stood up. She did it fast. The chair scraped again.

“I need another drink,” she said. “This one went down too fast. Like a shot.” She looked at Frank. “Want another, Miller? To forget the clean air?”

Frank looked at her. Her face was flushed. Her eyes darted. “I’m fine.”

“Suit yourself,” she said. “Tom? Want to brave the bar with me?”

Tom shook his head. “I’m good here, El. Jack will bring it.”

“Jack is too slow,” she said. “I need speed. Speed and oblivion.” She smiled again. A wide, bright smile. It didn’t reach her eyes. “See you in a bit.”

She walked away. Fast. Towards the bar. Her red dress was a flash in the crowd. She laughed at something. Her laugh carried. Frank watched her. Until she was gone into the throng.

Tom took a slow drink. He watched Frank.

“She’s a mess, Frank,” Tom said.

Frank did not answer. He stared at the empty space where she had been.

“She always was,” Tom said. “But the war… it made it worse. For all of us. But for her…” He trailed off.

Frank picked up his glass. He swirled the amber liquid. He watched it move.

“She runs,” Frank said.

“She does,” Tom agreed. “From everything. From herself most of all.”

“She’ll break herself,” Frank said. He said it very quietly.

Tom nodded. “Maybe that’s what she wants. To feel something. Anything.”

The music from the piano picked up speed. A woman sang. Her voice was high. Thin.

Frank looked at Tom. “She mentioned my drawings.”

Tom nodded. “You still do them.”

“Sometimes,” Frank said. “When I can sleep.”

“The dreams still bad?” Tom asked. His voice was low. He knew.

Frank looked away. He looked at the wall. He did not answer.

Tom did not press. He knew too. He had his own. Not the same. But bad enough.

Eleanor was at the bar. She was talking to a man. He was tall. He laughed. She laughed too. Her head tilted back. Her red dress was bright under the low lights.

Frank watched her. He felt a tightening in his chest. It was old. It was familiar.

He took a slow drink. The whiskey burned. It was good.

She turned from the man. She looked across the room. Her eyes found Frank’s again. A quick, hard look. Then she smiled at the tall man. She leaned in close. She said something. He smiled wider.

“She needs something to chase,” Tom said. He said it to the table. Not to Frank.

“Yes,” Frank said.

“And something to run from,” Tom said.

“Yes,” Frank said again.

He put his glass down. He watched her. She was a bright, moving thing. Always moving. Always shining. Always hurting.

She took a new drink. She raised it. To the man beside her. Then she drank.

Frank felt the ache. It was always there. Like a dull throb. Beneath everything. The noise. The whiskey. The smoke.

He reached for his cigarettes. He pulled one out. He lit it. The match flared. A brief light. Then smoke.

Tom watched him. He did not speak. He understood.

Eleanor was dancing now. With the tall man. She moved fast. Her red dress swirled. Her head was thrown back. She laughed.

Frank watched her. He took a long drag from his cigarette. The smoke was acrid. It was good.

“She can’t stay still,” Frank said.

“No,” Tom said. “She never could.”

“And she can’t stay,” Frank added.

Tom looked at him. Their eyes met. There was a shared understanding. A quiet, heavy thing. They had known this for a long time. They would know it for a long time yet.

Frank watched Eleanor dance. She was a beautiful ruin. Always seeking, always fleeing. The sun rose. But the wounds remained. He knew this. He tasted it in the whiskey. He felt it in his chest. He saw it in her too bright eyes.

He put out his cigarette in the ashtray. The smoke curled up. It joined the haze in the room. He picked up his glass. The ice clinked. He drank. The glass was cold. The whiskey was warm. It went down. It was a familiar feeling. It was solid. For a moment.
