# Chapter 7
A Proposition

The bar was quiet for a Tuesday afternoon. Frank sat at their usual table by the window. He watched the light fade on the street. It was still early for the crowds. Tom slid into the opposite chair. He signaled the waiter.

"Whiskey," Tom said. "And another for my friend."

The waiter nodded. He moved away.

Frank looked at his glass. The ice was almost gone. "Thanks."

"Anything new?" Tom asked.

Frank shook his head. "No. Nothing new."

The waiter brought the fresh drinks. The clink of the glass was sharp. Tom took a long swallow. He set the glass down hard.

"I've been thinking," Tom said.

Frank looked at him. "About what?"

"About leaving," Tom said. "For a while."

Frank did not speak. He picked up his fresh glass. He turned it in his hands.

"The city is getting to me," Tom said. "All of it. The noise. The heat."

Frank took a drink. The whiskey was good. It settled something. "It's always here."

"Yes," Tom said. "Always here. But maybe we don't have to be."

Frank looked out the window again. A delivery truck rumbled past. A woman with a bright hat hurried down the sidewalk.

"I know a place," Tom said. "Out West. Montana."

Frank turned his head slowly. "Montana."

"Yes. A cabin. On a river. Good fishing." Tom leaned forward slightly. "Clean air, Frank. Clear water. No noise. Just the river."

Frank thought of the river. He thought of the quiet. The hum of the city was always there. It was a dull ache sometimes.

"Trout," Tom said. "Big ones. They rise in the evening."

Frank nodded. He imagined the line on the water. The silver flash.

"No fuss," Tom said. "No people talking too much. No one asking questions."

Frank took another drink. He looked at Tom. Tom's face was serious. His eyes were clear.

"Sounds good," Frank said.

"It will be," Tom said. He took another sip of his whiskey. "Just us. The river. The mountains."

"How long?" Frank asked.

"A few weeks," Tom said. "A month. Until we're tired of it. Until it does what it's supposed to do."

"What's that?" Frank asked.

Tom shrugged. "Clear the head. Fix what's broken. Or make us forget for a while."

Frank looked into his whiskey glass. He saw the amber swirl. He saw nothing else.

"What about El?" Frank asked. The name came out flat.

Tom sighed. He picked up his glass. He drank. "No El," he said. His voice was firm.

Frank looked at him. His jaw tightened just a little.

"She wouldn't like it," Tom said. "Too quiet for her. Too slow. No new men every night."

Frank did not respond. He knew Tom was right. El ran from the quiet. She ran from herself. The quiet would only make her restless. It would make her break things.

"This is for us," Tom said. "For some peace. You need it, Frank. I need it."

Frank thought of the engine. The metal parts. The way he kept polishing the goggles. The sky that was no longer his. Maybe the quiet would help. Maybe the river would be solid.

"When do we leave?" Frank asked.

Tom smiled. It was a small smile. "Soon. As soon as we can get tickets. Get some gear."

Frank nodded. "Good."

The door of the bar opened. A figure stepped inside. It was Leo. He blinked in the dim light. He looked around. His eyes were bright.

"Frank. Tom," Leo said. He walked towards their table. He pulled up an empty chair.

"Leo," Tom said. "What brings you here?"

"I was walking," Leo said. "Thinking. And then I saw you. How are you both?"

"We're fine," Frank said. His voice was quiet.

"We were just talking about a trip," Tom said.

Leo's eyes widened. "A trip? Where?"

"Out West," Tom said. "Montana. Fishing."

"Montana," Leo repeated. His voice held a note of wonder. "The West. I've always wanted to see it. The wide open spaces. The mountains."

"It's wide, alright," Tom said. "And open. And the mountains are there."

"Is it like the stories?" Leo asked. "Cowboys? Ranches?"

Tom chuckled. "Some of it. More quiet than that now. More about the land itself."

"Fishing, you said?" Leo asked. "What kind of fish?"

"Trout," Frank said. He said the word simply.

"Trout," Leo repeated. "I've never fished for trout. I've only seen them in books."

"It's different than books," Tom said.

Leo leaned forward. His eyes were eager. "How different?"

"You feel the line," Frank said. "You feel the water."

"It sounds... real," Leo said.

Tom looked at Frank. Frank kept his face still.

"It is real," Tom said. "Real quiet. Real clean."

"No noise," Frank added.

"No El," Tom said. He looked at Frank as he said it. Frank's face did not change.

Leo looked between them. He did not ask about El. He had seen enough of her.

"What do you need to go?" Leo asked. "Rods? Flies?"

"Yes," Tom said. "All of it. We'll get it together."

"Can I come?" Leo asked. He blurted it out. His cheeks colored slightly. "I mean, I know it's probably just for you two. But I could help. I could learn. I could carry things."

Tom looked at Frank. Frank was looking at Leo. Leo's face was earnest. His desire was plain.

"You've never fished?" Frank asked.

"No," Leo said. "Never. But I learn fast. I watch. I listen."

Frank thought of the city. The noise. The women who talked too much. Leo was different. He watched. He listened. He wanted to understand.

"It's a lot of quiet," Frank said.

"I like quiet," Leo said. "I like to think. I like to write things down."

"You write?" Tom asked.

"Yes," Leo said. "Sometimes. Just observations. Things I see. Things people say."

Tom considered this. "There will be a lot to see out there," he said. "And not much said."

"I think that's good," Leo said. "Sometimes the most important things are not said."

Frank took another drink. He looked at Leo. Leo was young. He was new. He had not seen what they had seen. But he was looking. He was trying to.

"Can he come, Frank?" Tom asked.

Frank nodded once. It was a small movement. "He can come."

Leo grinned. It was a wide grin. "Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Tom."

"Don't thank us yet," Tom said. "It's a long train ride. And the quiet can get to you."

"I'll be fine," Leo said. He was still grinning. "It will be good. Away from the city. Away from... everything."

Frank thought of El. He thought of her laugh. He thought of her eyes when she was restless. He thought of her hand on his arm. He thought of her pushing away.

"We leave in a week," Tom said. "Max. I'll get the tickets. We'll meet at the station."

"A week," Leo said. He looked like a boy on Christmas Eve.

Frank watched him. He saw the idealism. It was still there. Untouched by the war. Untouched by El. He wondered what the West would do to it. He wondered what it would do to them all.

He finished his whiskey. The ice was gone again. The glass was empty.
