# Chapter 8
Saying Goodbye to the City

The whiskey was good. It was dark in the speakeasy. The air was thick with smoke and the smell of stale beer. Frank sat at a small table near the back. Tom was across from him. Leo sat next to Tom.

"The train leaves Friday," Tom said. He pushed his glass forward.

Frank nodded. He watched the door. It opened and closed. People came in. People went out.

"Montana," Leo said. He looked excited. "It will be very different."

"It will be quiet," Tom said. He took a drink. "Too quiet for some."

Frank said nothing. He watched the door again.

The music started then. A saxophone wailed. A piano pounded. The noise picked up.

Eleanor came in. She wore a green dress. It was silk. It moved when she walked. Her hair was cut short. Her eyes found their table. She smiled. It was a quick smile. It did not stay.

She walked to the bar first. She ordered a drink. She talked to the bartender. Then she turned. She saw them again. She walked over.

"Still here?" she asked Frank. Her voice was loud over the music.

Frank nodded. "Still here."

"Tom," she said. She looked at him. "Leo."

Leo stood up. "Eleanor." He was polite.

"Sit down," she said. She waved a hand. She pulled up a chair. It scraped the floor. She sat between Frank and Leo.

"What are you drinking?" she asked Frank.

"Whiskey."

"Give me one," she said to the waiter. He nodded. He went away.

"What were you talking about?" she asked. She looked at Tom.

Tom shrugged. "Nothing much."

"Sounds dull," she said. She lit a cigarette. The smoke went up.

"We were talking about the trip," Leo said. He leaned forward. His eyes were bright.

Eleanor looked at him. "Trip? What trip?"

"Montana," Leo said. "For fishing."

Eleanor laughed. It was a sharp sound. "Fishing? How utterly dull. For whom?"

"For us," Tom said. He looked at Frank. Frank watched Eleanor.

"You're going fishing?" Eleanor asked Frank. She raised an eyebrow.

Frank nodded. "That's the plan."

"And you," she said to Leo. "You're going too?"

"Yes," Leo said. "I'm looking forward to it."

The waiter came back. He put a glass in front of Eleanor. She took a long drink.

"Montana," she said. She blew out smoke. "Big skies. Empty country. Sounds like a cure for something."

"Maybe it is," Tom said. His voice was flat.

Eleanor looked at Frank again. She tilted her head. "And you, Miller? You going to find yourself out there? Or just more quiet?"

Frank took a sip of his whiskey. "Just going."

"It's a week from Friday," Tom said. He looked at Eleanor. His eyes were steady.

Eleanor put her cigarette out. She crushed it in the tray. She did not speak for a moment. She looked at Frank. She looked at Tom. She looked at Leo.

"A week," she said. She picked up her glass. "That's not long."

"No," Tom said. "It's not long."

"And you'll be gone?" she asked. She spoke to Frank.

"Yes."

"For how long?"

"A few weeks," Tom said. "Maybe longer."

Eleanor took another drink. She finished it. She put the glass down hard. It clinked on the table.

"I need another one," she said. She looked around for the waiter.

The waiter came. He took her order.

She turned back to them. Her eyes were bright again. Too bright.

"So," she said. "Just the three of you? Three men in the wilderness." She laughed again. It was the same sharp laugh. "Sounds like a story."

"Maybe," Leo said. He had his small notebook out. He had been writing. He put it away quickly.

"What are you writing, Leo?" she asked. She leaned closer. "Secrets?"

Leo shook his head. "Just observations."

"Observations," she repeated. She smiled. "You should observe Frank. He's full of them."

Frank looked at her. His face was still.

"He doesn't talk much," she said. "But he sees everything. Don't you, Frank?"

Frank did not answer. He just watched her.

The waiter brought her drink. She took it. She held it. She did not drink it.

"Montana," she said again. She rolled the word around her tongue. "Empty. Quiet."

She looked at Frank's face. She looked at his eyes. There was something there. She saw it. Or she thought she did.

She put her glass down. Her hand was steady.

"Wait for me," she said. Her voice was firm. There was no hesitation.

Tom stiffened. He looked at her.

"What?" he said. His voice was low.

"I'm coming," she said. She looked at Frank. Her eyes challenged him. "I'm coming with you."

Tom sighed. It was a soft sound. But it was clear.

"Eleanor," Tom began. He spoke slowly.

"No," she said. She cut him off. "I'm coming. Don't argue, Tom. You know I won't be left out."

Frank's expression did not change. He looked at her. He looked at Tom. He looked at the bottom of his glass.

"You won't like it," Tom said. He picked up his own glass. "It's not your kind of thing."

"Maybe it is," she said. She took a drink of her new whiskey. "How do you know what my kind of thing is, Tom?"

"The quiet," Tom said. "The peace. You don't like it."

"I like whatever I want to like," she said. Her voice was hard. "And I want to see this quiet. This peace. What is it good for?"

Leo looked from Eleanor to Tom. He watched Frank. Frank sat very still.

"It's fishing," Tom said. He spoke to Frank now. He ignored Eleanor. "Fishing and clean air."

"And I'll be there," Eleanor said. She smiled. It was a cold smile. "To add some interest."

"You'll be bored," Tom said. He shook his head.

"Then I'll be bored," she said. "I've been bored before. It's nothing new."

She looked at Frank again. His face gave away nothing. It was like a mask.

"So," she said. "Am I coming or not, Miller?"

Frank looked at her. He took a slow breath. He let it out.

"Come," he said. His voice was low. It was quiet.

Tom's shoulders dropped a little. He took another drink. He did not look at Eleanor.

Eleanor smiled a real smile this time. It showed her teeth.

"Good," she said. "Then it's settled."

She finished her whiskey. She stood up. She swayed a little.

"I'll meet you at the train," she said. "Friday. Don't forget me."

"We won't forget you," Tom said. His voice was dry.

She did not answer him. She looked at Frank one last time. Her eyes held something. It was fast. It was gone.

She walked away from the table. She went back to the bar. She found the man she had been talking to before. He laughed at something she said. She laughed too. It was loud.

Frank watched her. He watched her until she was just a blur in the crowded room.

"She won't last a day," Tom said. He looked at Frank.

Frank picked up his glass. He drank the last of his whiskey.

"No," Frank said. "She won't."

He put the glass down. It was empty. He looked at the door. He looked at the crowd. The noise was still there. It filled the room. It filled his head.

Leo looked at Frank. He looked at Tom. He wrote something in his notebook. His face was serious now. He did not look like he was going on a fishing trip. He looked like he was going somewhere else. Somewhere complicated.

Frank got up.

"Going?" Tom asked.

"For air," Frank said.

He walked past the tables. He walked past the bar. He walked past Eleanor. She did not see him go. He went out into the street. The air was cool. It was not quiet. The city was always loud. It never slept. It never forgot. It just kept moving. And they moved with it. Or tried to.
