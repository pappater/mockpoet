# Chapter 9
Westward Bound

The train pulled out of the station. It was Friday. Frank watched the platforms slide past. Tom sat across from him. Leo sat by the window. El stood in the aisle, looking back.

The city moved away. Factories. Warehouses. Tenement blocks. They slid past. Smoke stained the brick. The air was grey.

El dropped into the seat next to Frank. She smoothed her dress.
"Well," she said. "We're off."
Frank nodded. He did not look at her. He watched the city fall behind.

"It's loud," Leo said. He peered out the window.
"It will get quieter," Tom said. He opened a newspaper.
El sighed. She fumbled in her bag. She pulled out a silver flask.
"Already?" Tom asked. He did not look up from the paper.
"It's a long ride, Tom," El said. She unscrewed the top. She took a drink.

The train rattled. It picked up speed. The buildings grew smaller. Then they were gone. Green fields began to show. Farmhouses stood alone.
"Look at that," Leo said. His voice was low. He pointed. A red barn.
"Lots of them," Frank said.
El leaned her head against the window. Her eyes were closed.

The car swayed. The rhythm of the wheels was steady. Frank watched the fields. They stretched out. Then came fences. Trees. More fields. The land was flat. It was wide.
El stirred. She opened her eyes.
"This is dull," she said.
"It's just beginning," Tom said. He turned a page.

They sat in silence for a while. The sun was high. It streamed through the windows. Dust motes danced in the light.
"What time is dinner?" El asked.
"When they ring the bell," Tom said.
She stood up. She stretched. Her dress pulled tight across her.
"I'm going to find the dining car," she said.
"It'll be crowded," Tom told her.
She just smiled. She walked away. Her heels clicked on the floor.

Leo watched her go. He watched the countryside.
"She's very… lively," Leo said.
Frank grunted.
"She always is," Tom said. He folded the newspaper. He put it on his lap. "Especially on a train."

The bell rang for dinner. Frank and Tom and Leo walked to the dining car. It was already full. El was at a table near the window. She was talking to two men. They laughed. She laughed too. It was a loud sound.

They found a small table by themselves. A waiter came. He took their order.
"She made friends fast," Leo said.
"She always does," Frank said. He watched El. She was holding a drink.
"He's a salesman from Chicago," Tom said. He nodded towards one of the men. "The other one sells lumber."
Leo looked at Tom. "How do you know?"
"I walked past their compartment," Tom said. "They were talking about it."

El looked over. She saw them. She waved her hand. She smiled. Frank did not smile back. He looked at his water glass.

They ate their dinner. It was simple. Roast beef. Potatoes. Peas. The train rocked.
El was still at her table when they left. She had another drink. The men were still laughing.

Back in their compartment, the light was fading. The fields were still there. But the colours were softer. Long shadows stretched from the trees.
"It's getting cold," Leo said. He shivered.
"It always does at night," Frank said.
El came back much later. The car was quiet. She smelled of whiskey and perfume.
"They were fun," she said. She dropped into her seat.
"I'm sure they were," Tom said. His voice was flat.
She took out her flask again. She did not offer it.
"It's a long way," El said. She stared out into the dark. There was nothing to see now. Just the blackness rushing past.
"Yes," Frank said. "It is."

The next morning, the landscape was different. The fields were wider. The sky was bigger. There were no more towns. Only small clusters of houses. Far apart.
Leo was up early. He pressed his face to the window.
"It's enormous," he said. His eyes were wide.
Frank was already awake. He was looking out too. He had been for a long time.
"Yes," Frank said. "It is."

El woke later. She was quiet. She did not touch her flask. She drank coffee. Black.
"Where are we?" she asked.
"Nebraska," Tom said. He pointed to a small station they were passing. The sign was faded.
She looked out. Her expression was blank.
"Still flat," she said.
"It changes," Frank said.
"Everything does," she answered.

They went to the observation car after breakfast. It was at the very end of the train. The windows wrapped around. They could see the tracks behind them. They could see the land stretch out.
Leo gasped. The vastness of it was too much.
"I've never seen anything like it," he said.
Frank leaned against the rail. He watched the horizon. It was a clean line. No buildings broke it. Just sky and land.
El sat on a plush seat. She lit a cigarette. She watched Frank.
"Thinking about flying, Miller?" she asked. Her voice was low.
Frank did not answer. He just watched the sky. It was a perfect blue. No clouds.

Tom came and stood next to Frank. He looked at the same horizon.
"Clean," Tom said.
Frank nodded.
El blew a stream of smoke. "It's too clean. Too empty."
"That's the point," Tom said.
El shrugged. She put out her cigarette. She opened her flask.

They rode through the day. The sun was hot. The air inside the car grew heavy. The land rolled now. It was not flat. Gentle hills rose and fell. Grasses swayed in the wind the train made.
"Will we see mountains soon?" Leo asked. He was still glued to the window.
"Tomorrow, maybe," Frank said. "Or the day after."
"It feels like it will never end," Leo said.
"It does," Tom said. "But it does."

El went back to their compartment. She stayed there for a long time. Frank saw her later, in the corridor. She was talking to the salesman from Chicago again. He held her arm. She smiled up at him. Frank did not stop. He walked past them. He went to the dining car. He ordered a whiskey. He drank it fast.

He went back to the observation car. The sun was setting. The sky was orange and red. It was big. It was bigger than anything he had seen in New York. The colours bled into each other.
Leo was there. He was writing in a small notebook. He looked up when Frank came in.
"It's beautiful," Leo said. He held his pencil.
Frank nodded. He stood by the window. The light faded quickly. The stars began to show. They were clear. They were many. More than in the city.
"It makes you feel small," Leo said. He wrote something.
"It does," Frank said. He watched the stars. He thought of the war. He thought of the sky. He thought of the things that were lost there.

El joined them after a while. She looked tired. She had changed her dress.
"It's dark out there," she said.
"It's night," Frank said.
She sat down. She did not speak for a time. She just looked out.
"I can't sleep on trains," she said.
"Many people can't," Tom said. He had come in too.
"I don't like the feeling of moving and not being in control," she said.
Frank looked at her. He said nothing. He watched the stars. They were steady. The train was not.

The next day, the land began to change again. The hills grew sharper. Trees appeared. Pine trees. Dark green. The air seemed different. It was cooler. It smelled clean.
Leo was excited. He pointed to every new thing.
"Look! A river!"
"Yes," Frank said. "That's the Yellowstone."
The river was wide. The water was clear. It moved fast.

El looked out. A flicker of interest crossed her face.
"It's a lot of water," she said.
"Good for fishing," Tom said.
She made a face. "Dull."
"Not always," Frank said.
He watched the river. He imagined the feel of the rod. The pull of a fish. The quiet.

They stopped at a small station for water. There were men on the platform. Cowboys. They wore hats and boots. They looked at the train. They looked at El.
El smiled at them. She waved.
"They seem nice," she said.
"They're just curious," Tom said.
The train started again. The cowboys waved back.

The mountains began to show themselves in the distance. Blue shapes against the blue sky. They grew bigger. They grew clearer.
Leo stared. "They're huge."
"That's Montana," Frank said. His voice was low. There was something in it.
"It's different out here," Leo remarked.
Frank nodded. He did not say anything more. He just watched the mountains grow.

El had a drink from her flask. She had been quiet for a while.
"It's too quiet," she said. "The city always had noise. Even at night."
"This has different noise," Tom said. "The wind. The river. The animals."
She shivered. "I prefer the other kind."
Frank watched her. Her eyes were restless. She looked from one mountain to another. She looked at the sky. She looked back at the train.

They passed through a small town. A few dusty buildings. A general store. A saloon. A church. It was smaller than any town Leo had seen.
"Is this where we get off?" Leo asked.
"Not yet," Tom said. "A few more stops."
The people on the platform were still. They watched the train pass. Their faces were weathered. Hard.

El sighed. She closed her eyes.
"I need a real drink," she said.
"We'll find one," Tom told her. "In a town. Not on the train."
She opened her eyes. She looked at Frank.
"You're very quiet, Miller," she said.
"I'm watching," he said.
"Watching what?"
"The land," he said. "It tells you things."
She snorted. She looked away. She opened her flask again.

The light was fading once more. The mountains now filled the horizon. Their peaks were jagged. Snow gleamed on some of them. Even in summer.
Leo was still at the window. He wrote more in his notebook. His pen scratched on the paper.
Frank watched him. He watched the mountains. He felt the rumble of the train. It was taking them somewhere. Somewhere different.
He looked at El. She was asleep. Her head rested against the glass. The flask was in her lap. Her mouth was slightly open.
He looked at Tom. Tom was reading his newspaper again. He looked steady. Solid.
The train whistle blew. It was a long, lonely sound. It echoed in the vastness. It went on and on. It was a sound that made you feel small. It was a sound that made you feel far from home. It was a sound that told you everything was changing. The journey was not over. It had just begun.
