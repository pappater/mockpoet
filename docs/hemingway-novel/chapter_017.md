# Chapter 17
A Shared Silence

The morning was cold. A thin mist rose from the river. Frank was awake before the light. He dressed without sound. Tom moved in the cabin. He made coffee. No words passed between them.

Frank took his fishing rod. Tom took his. They walked to the river. The air was sharp. They walked in single file. The path was worn.

The river was still. The mist burned off as the sun rose. They stepped into the water. The current was cold against their boots.

Frank cast his line. He watched it land. The fly settled. He began to work it. Tom cast beside him. They moved in unison. No talk was needed. The river spoke enough.

The sun climbed higher. The air warmed. Frank felt the pull of the water. It was a good pull. It was steady. It was real.

Tom fished his stretch. He watched his line. He wore his old hat. The brim was frayed.

A flask came out of Tom’s jacket. He uncorked it. He held it out. Frank took it. He drank. The whiskey was good. It burned. He handed the flask back. Tom drank. Their eyes met. No words were said. There was no need.

They cast again. The line went out. It landed light. The current took it.

Leo sat on a rock far upriver. He watched them. He had his notebook. He did not write. He watched the two men. They stood in the water. They moved their rods. They were shadows against the bright river.

He saw the way they cast. The way their bodies moved. The rhythm of it. He saw the shared flask. He saw the quiet.

Leo felt something. It was not a sad feeling. It was not a happy feeling. It was a true feeling. He put his pen down. He watched the river run. He watched the two men.

Frank felt the sun on his face. The water on his legs. He felt the weight of the rod. He felt the pull of the line. These things were good.

He thought of the city. The noise. The rooms. El’s words. They were far away now. The river took them. The current pulled them down.

Tom moved to a deeper pool. He waded slowly. He was careful with his steps. Frank watched him. Tom was a good man. He was solid.

The fish were slow. Or maybe they were too fast. It did not matter. The act was enough. The moving. The casting. The waiting.

Leo picked up his pen. He wrote a line. Then another. He looked at the men again. Their backs were straight. Their movements were sure.

He wrote about the water. The way it moved around their boots. He wrote about the silence. The way it filled the air. He wrote about the sun. The way it made the water gleam.

He saw the lines on their faces. The way their hands gripped the rods. He saw the way they stood. It was a stance of knowing. Of having been through things.

Frank cast again. He let the line drift. He felt the sun on his arms. It was warm. It was real.

He did not think of flying. He did not think of the crash. He did not think of the engine. Not now. The river was enough.

Tom whistled a low tune. It was a tune without words. Frank knew it. He had heard it before. Many times.

The day stretched out. The sun moved across the sky. The shadows lengthened. They moved downriver. They moved with the sun.

No fish were kept. Or maybe one was. It was not the point. The point was the river. The point was the air. The point was the quiet.

They came to a bend. The current ran faster here. The water was deeper. Tom stopped. Frank stopped beside him.

Tom looked at the sky. He looked at Frank. He nodded once. Frank nodded back. It was time.

They walked back up the path. The shadows were long now. The air was getting cool. The cabin stood dark against the trees.

They put their rods away. They cleaned their boots. They sat on the porch. The quiet was there with them. It was a good quiet. It was a shared quiet.

Leo watched them from the cabin door. He saw them sit. He saw the last of the sun hit their faces. He closed his notebook. He understood something new. It was not in words. It was in the air. It was in the quiet.
