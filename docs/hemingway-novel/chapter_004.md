# Chapter 4
The City's Pulse

They left the first speakeasy. The street was colder now. The air bit. They walked fast, four of them, down a side street. Tom knew another place.

"It's louder there," Tom said. "More life."

"Life is loud," Eleanor said. She laughed.

Leo walked with them. He looked from Frank to Tom. He said nothing.

They went through another heavy door. Down a short flight of stairs. The new place was packed. Smoke hung in the air. Music blared from a horn. A piano hammered. People pushed against each other.

"Here we are," Tom said. He pushed through the crowd.

They found a small table near the back. It was hard to hear. Frank pulled out a chair. El sat down hard. Leo squeezed in next to Tom.

A waiter came. Frank ordered a whiskey. Tom ordered the same. El ordered a gin fizz. Leo asked for a beer.

The music was fast. It made your feet want to move. People danced close. They spun apart. Their faces were flushed.

Eleanor drank her gin fizz. She drank it fast.

"This is better," she said. She leaned in to be heard. "More happening."

Frank watched the dancers. His glass was cool in his hand.

"It is loud," he said. His voice was low.

Eleanor finished her drink. She set the glass down. It hit the table hard.

"I need another," she said. She waved at the waiter.

"Take it easy, El," Tom said. He watched her.

"Why?" she asked him. Her eyes flashed. "What's the hurry?"

The waiter brought her another drink. She took it. She stood up from the table.

"I'm going to dance," she said. "This music is good."

She walked toward the dance floor. It was a mass of bodies. She moved into it.

Frank watched her. She found a man. He was tall. He smiled at her. She smiled back. They began to dance.

The music got faster. Eleanor spun. Her red dress swirled. She laughed. Her head was thrown back. She moved from the tall man to another. Then another. She did not stop.

Frank drank his whiskey. He watched her. His face showed nothing.

Leo leaned over to Tom. "She has so much energy," he said.

Tom nodded. He looked at Frank. Frank did not look back.

"She always did," Tom said to Leo. "More now."

Eleanor was a blur on the dance floor. She danced with a man in a blue suit. Then a man with slicked-back hair. She did not seem to care who they were. She just danced.

Frank finished his whiskey. He signaled the waiter. Another one.

"She'll break herself in two," Tom said. He watched El. His voice was quiet. He said it to Frank.

Frank took his new glass. He held it. The ice clinked.

"Maybe she wants to," Frank said. His eyes were on Eleanor.

She was laughing now. The man with the slicked-back hair held her close. Too close. She pulled away and spun. She found another partner. She did not look at their table.

"It's a way to feel something," Tom said. He watched Frank.

Frank nodded. He sipped his drink. He did not speak.

"Or not feel," Tom added.

The noise in the room was a wall. It pushed in on them. Frank felt it. He felt the thump of the bass. The blare of the horn. The shouts and laughter. It was all loud. It was all fast.

Leo was watching El too. His face was thoughtful. Not naive anymore. Just observing. He saw the way she moved. The way she laughed. The way she did not look at them.

"Does she ever just sit still?" Leo asked. He asked Tom.

Tom shook his head. "Not for long," he said. "Not for anything that lasts."

Frank drank his whiskey. It burned going down. It was good.

Eleanor stopped dancing. She was breathing hard. She leaned against a pillar. A man brought her a drink. She took it. She smiled at him. It was a quick smile. Then she was dancing again.

Frank watched her. The muscles in his jaw moved. Just a little. Almost imperceptible.

"Jimmy's not here tonight," Tom said. He said it casually. He watched Frank.

Frank kept his eyes on Eleanor. "No," he said.

"That's good," Tom said. "It's always trouble with him."

Frank did not answer. He watched Eleanor. She was dancing with a new man. This one was older. He moved slowly. She moved around him. She was like a bird. Fast. Untouchable.

"She just moves," Leo said. He still watched her. "Like she can't stop."

"She can't," Tom said. "It's how she is."

Frank finished his drink. He put the glass down. He did not ask for another. Not yet.

He watched Eleanor. The music carried her. The men held her. Then she was gone from them. She was a flash of red. She was a laugh. She was a drink swallowed fast.

"You should get some sleep, Frank," Tom said. He looked tired.

Frank nodded. He did not move. He kept watching the dance floor.

Eleanor spun. She looked up. Her eyes met Frank's across the room. Just for a moment. Then she looked away. She danced with renewed energy. Her face was bright. Hard.

Frank watched her. His hand was on the table. His knuckles were white.

The music played on. The night was loud. The drinks were strong. Eleanor was still dancing. Frank was still watching. He felt the familiar ache. It was not new. It was always there.

He looked at Tom. Tom watched him.

"She'll keep on," Tom said. "Until she drops."

Frank looked back to Eleanor. "Yes," he said. "She will."

He felt it. He felt the pull. He felt the push. She was a storm. He was the ground. The ground did not move. It just took what came.

Leo sighed. He looked down at his beer. He did not understand. Not all of it. He watched Frank watch El. He knew there was something there. Something hard. Something that would not break. But something that hurt.

The music changed. It was slower now. People moved closer. Eleanor was still dancing. She did not slow down. She found a new partner. He was young. He pulled her close. She rested her head on his shoulder. Just for a moment. Then she pulled away. She laughed.

Frank stood up.

"I need air," he said. His voice was rough.

Tom nodded. He stood up too. Leo stood.

They moved through the crowd. The noise still hammered. The smoke still hung. They reached the heavy door. Frank pulled it open.

The street was cold. The air was clean. Frank took a deep breath. It burned his lungs. It was better.

"She'll be here," Tom said. He gestured back to the club. "For a while yet."

Frank nodded. He looked down the street. It was empty. The sound of the music was dull now. Faint.

He thought of Eleanor dancing. He thought of the way she spun. The way she laughed. The way she never stopped. He thought of her eyes meeting his. Just for a moment. Then looking away.

He felt the ache. It was a quiet thing. It was always there. It was what was left. He took another breath of the cold air.
