# Chapter 14
Conversations by the Fire

The fire settled in the hearth. Flames licked at the split logs. Outside, the night was cold and clear. Stars hung close above the dark mountains.

Frank sat at the rough-hewn table. He cleaned his fishing reel. His hands moved slow. He worked the oiled cloth over the metal. It made a soft sound.

El was on her cot. She faced the wall. Her breathing was even. She had been quiet since returning.

Tom poured more whiskey into two tin cups. He handed one to Leo.

"It's good out here," Leo said. He looked into the fire.

"It is," Tom said. He took a drink. The whiskey was strong.

Frank did not look up. He kept cleaning the reel.

"You like it, Frank?" Leo asked.

Frank nodded. He did not speak.

"It's different," Leo said. "From the city."

"Everything is different from the city," Tom said. He watched the fire. "That's why we come."

Leo stirred the whiskey in his cup. "I saw El earlier. With that rancher. Ben."

Tom grunted. "She gets along."

"She seemed… easy," Leo said. "More than usual."

"She needs to be," Tom said. "Sometimes."

Frank tightened a screw on the reel. The click was sharp in the quiet cabin.

"She talks about the war sometimes," Leo said. "She says it took things."

Tom nodded. "It takes a lot of things."

"What did it take from her?" Leo asked. His voice was low.

Tom looked at the flames. "From El? Her stillness. Maybe her belief in things lasting. The war makes a man or a woman think nothing lasts."

"And Frank?" Leo asked. He glanced at Frank’s back. Frank kept working.

"Frank flew," Tom said. "It's different in the air."

"He doesn't talk about it," Leo said.

"Some things you don't talk about," Tom said. "Some things you just carry."

The fire popped. A log shifted.

"Did it take things from you, Tom?" Leo asked.

Tom took a long drink. "From me? My quiet mornings. My easy sleep. Some beliefs. The war changes what you think about honor. About death. About a lot of things."

"Is that why you write?" Leo asked.

"Maybe," Tom said. "To try and make sense of it. To put it down. To stop carrying it around inside my head so much."

"Does it help?"

"Sometimes," Tom said. "For a while. Then you start again."

Frank put the reel down. He picked up a line. He checked it for fraying.

"Frank sees things," Tom said. He watched Frank's hands. "He always did. Up in the air. Now on the ground. He sees things. And he remembers."

"What does he remember?" Leo asked.

"The air," Tom said. "The engine. The clouds. The things he saw fall. The things that flew apart."

Leo thought about that. He looked at the quiet man. Frank’s face was still.

"He still dreams of it," Leo said. He remembered El's words.

"We all do," Tom said. "Dreams are good for that. To bring it back. To make you sweat."

"Do you think he'll fly again?" Leo asked.

Tom shrugged. "He works on the engine. Jimmy said it's a good engine."

"Who's Jimmy?"

"An old friend," Tom said. "He knows engines. He knew Frank before the war."

Frank did not turn. He kept checking the line. His movements were steady.

"El seems angry about it," Leo said. "About the engine. About Frank not flying."

"El is angry about a lot of things," Tom said. "She likes things fast. She likes things to break sometimes. To feel something sharp."

"Why?"

"Because it’s better than nothing," Tom said. "She thinks."

Leo looked at the fire. It burned bright. Then it was embers.

"It's hard to come back from it," Tom said. He spoke softly. "The war. It changes you. And the world moves on. But you don't move with it. Not in the same way."

"Is that why you come here?" Leo asked.

"The quiet helps," Tom said. "The river helps Frank. And the mountains. There's a truth in them. They don't lie. They don't try to forget."

Frank finished with the line. He started to put the reel back together.

"You learn to live with it," Tom said. "The things you saw. The things you did. The people you lost."

"Did you lose people, Tom?"

Tom nodded. His eyes were on the fire. "Everyone lost someone. Or some part of themselves."

Leo thought about his own clean life. His college books. The city cafes. He had not lost anything. Not like them.

"Frank lost more than most," Tom said. "His air. His freedom in the sky. It was his. And then it wasn't."

Leo watched Frank’s hands. The precise movements. The concentration. He saw it now. The way Frank worked on the reel. The way he cast the line. It was all about control. About order. About putting things back together.

"He doesn't talk about it," Leo said again.

"He doesn't need to," Tom said. "I know. He knows. That's enough."

"What do you know?"

"The ache," Tom said. "The quiet. The way some nights the ceiling comes down. The way some mornings the sun is too loud."

Leo listened. He felt a shiver. It was not from the cold.

"It's not just the bullets," Tom said. "That kill you. It's what happens after. Inside."

"How do you fix it?" Leo asked.

Tom shook his head. "You don't. You live with it. You find ways to make it quiet. Sometimes. You find things that help you breathe."

He looked at Frank. Frank put the reel back in its canvas bag. He stood up. He walked to the cabin door.

"He walks," Tom said. "He fishes. He cleans the gear. He watches the river. These things help him breathe."

Frank opened the door. The cold air rushed in. He stepped outside. The door closed softly behind him.

"He needs to walk," Tom said. "Under the stars. Where it's quiet. Where he can think."

Leo nodded. He understood now. More than before. He saw the weight Frank carried. He saw the effort. The constant effort.

"He looks for solid ground," Tom said. His voice was low. "Always. Everywhere."

Leo watched the door. He thought of the vast, dark night. Frank was out there. Alone. But not alone in what he carried.

"Do you think he'll find it?" Leo asked.

Tom took another drink. "He keeps looking," he said. "That's what matters. That he keeps looking."

The fire crackled. The only sound in the cabin. Leo drank his whiskey. It felt hot going down. He felt the weight now too. A small part of it. A small understanding. The war was never over for some men. It just moved inside them. And they lived with it. They found ways to live. They found ways to breathe. The sun still rose. But it was a different sun.
