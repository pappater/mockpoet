# Chapter 15
Frank's Flashback

The river ran clear. Frank stood in the cold water. The sun was high. It warmed his shoulders. His boots felt the smooth stones. He cast the line. It unspooled. The fly landed soft on the water.

He watched the current. He watched the fly. It drifted. He kept the line taut. His hands knew the rod. They knew the rhythm. The air smelled of pine. It smelled of cold water.

He had been fishing for hours. The quiet was good. It filled the spaces. The city did not have quiet. It had noise. Here, there was only the river. The wind moved the trees. He heard the water. That was all.

He worked the line. He cast again. The fly danced. He thought of nothing. That was the point. To think of nothing. To feel the rod. To feel the current. To feel the sun.

A shadow passed over the water. He looked up. An eagle circled high. It rode the air. It floated. Its wings were wide. They caught the light.

He watched it climb. He watched it turn. It moved without sound. It owned the sky.

His hands tightened on the rod. He watched the eagle. It wheeled. It made another circle. Higher now. A small dark speck.

The air felt different. Thinner. Colder. The sun was still bright. But the light changed. It shimmered.

He was in the cockpit. The engine roared. The wind tore at his face. The biplane bucked. The wings cut the air. He felt the controls. He felt the stick. It was solid in his hand.

Below, the ground spun. It was a map. Fields and rivers. Lines of trenches. Smoke. The smoke rose. It made a dark smudge.

He pushed the stick. The plane dipped. The G-forces pressed him back. He laughed. It was a good laugh. A clean sound. The engine answered. It was a living thing.

He saw the enemy. A Fokker. Black. It was fast. It came from the sun. He banked hard. The wing dipped low. The earth tilted.

His heart beat. It beat hard. It was a drum. He knew the plane. He knew its limits. He pushed them.

The Fokker was close. Too close. He saw the pilot. A blurred shape. He felt the cold in his gut.

He fired. The machine guns chattered. The tracers streamed out. They cut the air. He saw sparks. On the Fokker's wing. A hit.

The Fokker turned. It was quick. Too quick. He saw its guns flash. He heard the sound. A tearing noise. Metal. Fabric.

He felt the impact. A sharp shock. Through the stick. Through the seat. The plane shuddered. It bucked again. Harder this time.

The engine coughed. It sputtered. It was dying. The sound changed. A high whine. A scream. He pushed the stick. It did not respond. Not fully.

The ground came up. It rushed at him. Fast. Too fast. Trees. Earth. Broken things. He pulled the stick. Pulled it back. Hard.

The plane stalled. It dropped. It fell. Like a stone. He saw the river. It was a ribbon. Far below.

He fought the controls. His hands moved. They pulled. They pushed. Nothing. The plane spun. The world spun. Green and brown. Blue and grey. All a blur.

The engine was silent now. Only the wind. A shriek. The ground was close. He saw the rocks. The water. He saw his end.

He closed his eyes.

He was back in the river. The cold water ran around his boots. The sun was hot on his shoulders. The air smelled of pine.

His hands shook. They shook hard. The rod trembled. The line was slack. He stared at the water. The fly was gone. The line had snapped.

He felt the break. A sharp absence. Where the tension had been.

He pulled the line in. It was short. Frayed at the end. He looked at his hands. They still trembled. He looked at the sky. The eagle was gone.

He took the rod apart. He put it on the bank. He sat down on a smooth rock. His breath was short. He tried to breathe deep. The air was clean. But it did not clean him.

He felt the ache. It was there. Under his ribs. It never left. It just hid sometimes. In the quiet. In the rhythm.

He reached into his creel. He took out the small tin. He opened it. Flies. Different sizes. Different colors. He picked a new one. A small gray hackle.

He took the leader. He tried to tie a knot. A clinch knot. His fingers fumbled. The line was fine. It slipped.

He tried again. His thumb pressed the line. His forefinger tried to loop it. His hands were clumsy. They had been steady before. Steady in the plane. Steady with the rod. Now they were not.

He dropped the line. He dropped the fly. They fell in the dirt. He picked them up. He wiped the dirt off. His hands still shook.

He took a breath. A slow one. He looked at the river. It flowed on. It did not care. It moved past everything.

He thought of the engine. The one in the apartment. Jimmy had said it was good. A good design. He wanted to make it work. To make it fly.

He sat for a long time. The sun moved across the sky. The shadows lengthened. He picked up the line again. He tried another knot. His fingers were stiff.

He concentrated. On the line. On the loop. On the tuck. He shut out the wind. He shut out the river. He shut out the plane.

The knot tightened. It held. It was not perfect. But it would hold. He clipped the tag end. He tied on the fly.

He stood up. He walked to the river. The water was colder now. The sun was lower. He felt it on his neck.

He cast the line. It flew out. It landed true. The fly settled. He watched it. He watched the current. He waited.

The river moved on. It carried the fly. It carried the sun. It carried the day. He held the rod. He felt the cold water around his boots. The ache was still there. But it was duller now. A quiet hum. Like a distant engine.
