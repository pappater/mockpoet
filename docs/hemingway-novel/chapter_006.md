# Chapter 6
A Walk Through the Village

Frank stood by the curb. The sun was high. It cut sharp angles on the brick. The street was busy, even for an afternoon. Cabs honked. People walked fast.

Eleanor came out of the apartment building. She wore a light dress. Her hair was loose. She looked better than she had that morning.

"You waited," she said.

"It's a good day for walking," Frank said.

She nodded. They started down the street. It was Greenwich Village. Shops had open doors. Fresh bread smell mixed with exhaust.

"Where are we going?" she asked.

"Nowhere," he said. "Just walking."

She walked beside him. Her pace was quick. He kept his own steady.

A woman with a small dog passed them. The dog sniffed at the pavement.

"Dogs are good," Eleanor said.

"They are," Frank said.

They walked past a bookstore. Old books filled the window. A man in a cap sat inside, reading.

"I used to read more," Eleanor said.

Frank said nothing. He watched the man. The man turned a page.

They came to a corner. A newsstand was there. Headlines screamed about stocks. About scandals.

"Always something," Eleanor said. She did not look at the papers.

"Always," Frank said.

They turned onto another street. It was quieter here. Trees lined the sidewalk. Young leaves were bright green.

"It's nice," she said.

His hand brushed hers as they walked. He did not move his hand away. She did not move hers. They walked like that for a few steps. Then she swung her arm a little, and their hands parted.

"New shop," Eleanor said. She pointed to a storefront. It was selling hats. Bright colors. Feathers.

"They change them often," Frank said.

"Do they?"

"Yes."

She stopped to look in the window. A wide-brimmed hat caught her eye. She did not go inside.

"Would it suit me?" she asked.

"Maybe," Frank said.

She smiled. It was a brief smile. Then she moved on. He walked with her.

They walked past a café. People sat at small tables on the sidewalk. They drank coffee. They talked.

"Do you want coffee?" she asked.

"No," Frank said.

"Me neither."

A jazz tune drifted from an open window. It was slow. Muted.

"They play that everywhere now," she said.

"Yes."

She turned her head. She looked at him. Her eyes were bright.

"Are you still flying, Frank?" she asked.

He looked straight ahead. "No," he said.

"But you think about it."

"Sometimes."

"What do you think?"

"Nothing much."

She kicked at a small stone on the pavement. It skittered.

"Jimmy asked about the engine," she said.

Frank's jaw tightened. It was a small movement. "Did he?"

"Yes. He said it was a good engine."

"It is."

"Are you fixing it?"

"I am working on it."

"Will you fly it again?"

He stopped walking. He looked at her. His eyes were flat.

"What do you want, El?" he asked.

She looked away. She looked at the traffic on the cross street. She pulled her lip between her teeth.

"Nothing," she said. "I just asked."

They started walking again. Her steps were a little faster now. He matched them.

"It's all changing, isn't it?" she said. She gestured with her hand. At the street. At the city.

"Always does," Frank said.

"But faster now."

He did not answer. The sun felt warm on his face.

"Do you think about the war, Frank?" she asked. Her voice was softer.

"Sometimes," he said. It was always sometimes.

"Does it stop?"

"No."

She walked silently for a while. Her shoulders were a little hunched.

"I still dream about it," she said.

He said nothing. He knew.

"The noise," she said. "The mud. And the faces."

He looked at her. Her eyes were distant. He knew those eyes.

"Some things stay," he said.

"Everything stays," she said. "Doesn't it?"

He did not reply. A delivery truck rumbled past them. It left a smell of gasoline.

They came to a small park. It had benches. A few trees. Children played near a fountain. Their shouts were thin.

Eleanor walked towards a bench. She sat down. Frank stood.

"Sit," she said.

He sat beside her. The wood was warm.

"What are you looking for, Frank?" she asked.

He watched the children. They chased a ball. "Something solid," he said.

"Is there anything solid anymore?"

He did not answer. He looked at the sky. It was a pale blue. High up, a cloud moved. Slowly.

"I don't know what I'm looking for," she said. Her voice was low. "I just keep looking."

A child cried. Another laughed. The sounds were far away.

"You look too hard," Frank said.

She turned to him. Her eyes held something. Not anger. Not sadness. Something flat and tired.

"And you don't look hard enough," she said.

He did not flinch. He looked back at the cloud.

"I just want to feel," she said. "Really feel. For a moment."

He knew that. He knew it well.

"It costs too much," he said.

"Everything costs," she said. "Doesn't it?"

They sat there. The sun shifted. The shadows grew longer. The city hummed around them. It was a constant sound. A background to everything. A noise you could almost forget. Almost.
