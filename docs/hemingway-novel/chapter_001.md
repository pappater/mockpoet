# Chapter 1
The Empty Glass

Frank Miller sat at the small table. The table was wood. It was dark. The room was dark too. There was a window but no light came from it. Night was outside.

He held a glass. The glass was half full. It was whiskey. He watched the surface of the whiskey. It was still. He lifted the glass. He drank. The whiskey was good. It burned going down.

The speakeasy was full. Noise filled the room. Voices were loud. Laughter cut through the voices. A piano played. The music was fast. It was jazz. Smoke hung in the air. It made his eyes water. He did not mind.

He watched the door. People came in. People went out. They were all new people. He did not know them. He did not know anyone. He watched the door for a long time.

He took another drink. The glass was almost empty now. He looked at the bartender. The bartender was busy. He waved his hand. The bartender saw him. He nodded.

A man came in. He stood by the door. He looked around the room. He was tall. He had a strong face. He wore a good suit. He looked for something. His eyes moved over the tables. They stopped at Frank’s table. The man smiled. It was a good smile.

The man walked toward him. He walked with a purpose. He moved through the crowd. He did not bump anyone. He reached the table.

"Frank," the man said.
"Tom," Frank said.
Tom pulled out a chair. He sat down.
"Still here?" Tom asked.
"Still here," Frank said.
"Still drinking that stuff?" Tom asked.
"It’s good stuff," Frank said.
"I know it is," Tom said. "I know it very well."

Tom signaled the bartender. The bartender came over.
"Whiskey," Tom said. "The good kind."
"Right away, Mr. Harris," the bartender said. He went to get it.

Frank looked at Tom. Tom looked at Frank. They did not speak. They did not need to.
"Long day?" Frank asked.
"Every day is long," Tom said. "Some are longer than others."
"That’s true," Frank said. He finished his drink. The glass was empty. He put it down.
"Still looking for something, Frank?" Tom asked.
"Always, Tom," Frank said. "Always."

The bartender brought Tom’s drink. He set it down. It was a tall glass. Ice was in it.
"Another for you, Mr. Miller?" the bartender asked.
"Yes," Frank said. "The same."
The bartender nodded. He took Frank’s glass. He left.

"You look good," Frank said.
"I am good," Tom said. "I am always good. You do not look bad yourself."
"I am not bad," Frank said. "I am just here."
"Here is a place," Tom said.
"It is a place," Frank agreed.

Tom drank his whiskey. He drank it fast.
"Good," he said. "That is very good."
"I told you," Frank said.
"You did," Tom said. "You always tell the truth about whiskey."

The bartender brought Frank’s new drink. It was full. It was cold. Frank took a sip.
"Where were you?" Frank asked.
"At the office," Tom said. "Trying to write. Trying to make sense of things."
"Did you make sense of them?" Frank asked.
"No," Tom said. "Not today. Tomorrow perhaps. Or the day after."
"There is always another day," Frank said.
"That is what they say," Tom said. "They say a lot of things."

Tom watched the crowd. His eyes moved slowly. He saw everything.
"This place is always busy," Tom said.
"It is," Frank said. "People like to forget."
"Or to remember," Tom said. "It depends on the drink."
"Perhaps," Frank said. He did not look at Tom. He looked at the crowd.

A woman laughed loudly at a table near them. She had bright red lips.
"She is happy," Frank said.
"She is drinking," Tom said. "That is not the same thing."
"No," Frank said. "It is not the same thing."

Tom leaned forward. His voice was lower now. The noise of the room was still loud.
"You still sleep?" Tom asked.
"Sometimes," Frank said.
"The dreams?" Tom asked.
"Sometimes," Frank said again. "They are not always dreams."
"No," Tom said. "They are never just dreams."

Frank looked at his drink. He turned the glass. Ice clinked against the sides.
"The air was cold that day," Frank said.
"It was always cold up there," Tom said. "High above everything."
"Yes," Frank said. "High above everything."
"And then you were not," Tom said.
Frank did not answer. He took a long drink.

"You should go fishing," Tom said.
"Maybe," Frank said.
"It clears the head," Tom said. "The river runs. It takes things away."
"It does not take everything," Frank said.
"No," Tom said. "It does not. But it helps."
"I remember the rivers," Frank said. "Before."
"They are still there," Tom said. "They still run."

A couple danced close by. The man held the woman tight.
"They seem happy," Frank said.
"They are young," Tom said. "And they are dancing. That is good for them."
"It is good," Frank said.
He watched the dancers. Their feet moved fast. The music was loud.

Tom finished his second drink. He put the glass down. It made a sound.
"I saw her," Tom said.
Frank looked at him. He waited.
"Eleanor," Tom said.
"Oh," Frank said.
"She was at the Blue Door," Tom said. "With some fellow. He was loud."
"They usually are," Frank said.
"She looked the same," Tom said. "Hair cut short. Laughing too much."
"That is her way," Frank said.
"It is her way," Tom agreed. "She did not see me."
"That is also her way," Frank said.

He picked up his glass. He swirled the whiskey.
"She is restless," Frank said.
"She always was," Tom said. "The war did not change that. It made it worse."
"Everything is worse," Frank said.
"No," Tom said. "Not everything. Some things are just different."
"That is true," Frank said. "Different."

Tom called the bartender again.
"Two more," Tom said. "The same good stuff."
"Coming right up," the bartender said. He moved fast.

"What are you doing these days?" Tom asked.
"I work," Frank said. "I walk. I read the papers."
"What do you work at?" Tom asked.
"Sometimes I draw," Frank said. "Sometimes I don’t."
"The drawings are good," Tom said. "You should show them to someone."
"They are not for showing," Frank said.
"They are for you," Tom said.
"They are for me," Frank said. "They are just lines."

The bartender brought the drinks. Frank took a sip.
"This is a good place," Frank said.
"It is a place," Tom said. "It is not home."
"No," Frank said. "It is not home. Home is not here."
"Home is not anywhere," Tom said. "Not anymore."
"Perhaps," Frank said.

He felt the whiskey warm in his stomach. The noise of the room did not bother him. It was a blanket.
"Do you remember the quiet?" Frank asked.
"The quiet of the sky?" Tom asked.
"Yes," Frank said. "That quiet. Before the engines."
"I remember the quiet of the fields," Tom said. "Before the shells."
"It was a different quiet," Frank said.
"It was," Tom said. "A very different quiet. It is gone now."
"Yes," Frank said. "It is gone."

Tom took a deep breath. He exhaled slowly.
"We are still here," Tom said.
"We are," Frank said.
"That is something," Tom said.
"It is something," Frank agreed. "It is not everything."

A small band started playing. It was a saxophone, a trumpet, a drum. The music was faster than the piano. It made the room vibrate.
"The music is loud," Frank said.
"It helps," Tom said.
"Helps what?" Frank asked.
"It helps everything," Tom said. "It helps the time pass. It helps to not think."
"That is good," Frank said. "To not think."

He watched the people. Their faces moved. Their mouths moved. He could not hear their words. Only the music. Only the noise.
"I saw a paper today," Tom said. "They talk about the boom. About how good things are."
"Things are always good in the papers," Frank said.
"They say the country is fixed," Tom said.
"Is it fixed?" Frank asked.
"No," Tom said. "It is not fixed. Not for us."
"No," Frank said. "Not for us."

He drank some more. The glass was half empty again.
"What will you do tomorrow?" Frank asked.
"I will wake up," Tom said. "I will eat. I will try to write again. I will come here again perhaps."
"That sounds like a day," Frank said.
"It is a day," Tom said. "It is what we have."

Frank nodded. He did not look away from the crowd. He kept watching them.
"Do you ever think about going back?" Tom asked.
"Back where?" Frank asked.
"Back to the other side," Tom said. "To Europe."
"No," Frank said. "There is nothing there."
"There was once," Tom said.
"There was," Frank agreed. "It is gone now. It is all different."
"Yes," Tom said. "It is all different."

Tom leaned back in his chair. He watched Frank.
"You should come to the office sometimes," Tom said. "We could talk. Or not talk."
"Maybe," Frank said.
"It is a good office," Tom said. "It has light. It has a window that looks out onto the street."
"That is good," Frank said. "Light is good."
"Yes," Tom said. "Light is very good."

Frank finished his drink. He put the glass down.
"Are you hungry?" Tom asked.
"No," Frank said. "Not hungry."
"You should eat," Tom said. "A man needs to eat."
"I eat," Frank said. "Sometimes."

The music was still loud. The room was hot.
"We should go soon," Tom said. "It will be late."
"It is always late," Frank said.
"That is true," Tom said. "But it gets later."
"Yes," Frank said. "It always gets later."

Tom pushed his chair back. It scraped the floor. The sound was sharp.
"I will walk you home," Tom said.
"You do not have to," Frank said.
"I want to," Tom said. "The streets are full of things."
"They are," Frank said.
"And the things are not always good," Tom said.
"No," Frank said. "They are not."

Frank stood up. He felt the drink in him. It was a good feeling.
"Thank you for the drinks," Frank said.
"They were good drinks," Tom said. "They always are. With you."
"That is true," Frank said.

They walked out of the speakeasy. The door opened. A burst of cool air hit them. The street was colder than the bar. The night was dark. The city lights glowed. Cars drove past. Their tires made a soft sound.
"The air is good," Frank said.
"It is clean," Tom said. "Cleaner than inside."
"Yes," Frank said.

They walked in silence. Their footsteps echoed on the pavement. The city noise was around them. It was a different noise now. It was not a blanket. It was just noise.
"Still looking for solid ground?" Tom asked.
"Always," Frank said. "Always, Tom."
Tom nodded. He did not speak. They kept walking. The street lights cast long shadows. The shadows moved with them.
