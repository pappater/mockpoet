# Chapter 11
The River's Embrace

The morning broke clean. A thin mist hung over the river, but the sun was rising. It touched the peaks first, then spilled down the slopes. The air was cool and sharp. It felt good in the lungs.

Frank stood on the cabin porch. He drank black coffee. The smell of pine and damp earth was strong. He watched the river. It moved fast, green and cold.

Tom came out. He carried two fishing rods. Leo followed with a third.

"Good morning," Tom said.

Frank nodded. He finished his coffee.

Leo looked at the river. His eyes were wide. "It's big," he said.

"It moves," Frank said. "It pulls hard."

Eleanor appeared in the doorway. She wore a silk robe. Her hair was loose. She blinked in the light.

"You're going fishing?" she asked. Her voice was rough from sleep.

"That's right," Tom said. He checked the reels.

"How utterly primitive," she said. She yawned. "I suppose you'll be gone all day."

"Maybe," Frank said.

"I don't think I can stand the quiet," she said. She leaned against the doorframe. "It's too much."

"There's whiskey," Tom said. "In the cupboard."

Eleanor gave a short, bitter laugh. "Always an answer for everything, Tom." She disappeared back inside. The screen door swung shut.

Tom looked at Frank. Frank watched the river. He said nothing.

"Come on, Leo," Tom said. "Let's see if we can teach you something."

They walked down a narrow path. The grass was wet. The sound of the river grew louder. It was a good sound. A steady sound.

Frank carried a small tackle box. He had tied his fly to the leader last night. It was a Royal Coachman. A good fly for this water.

They reached a bend in the river. The water was deep here. It moved slower, eddying around rocks. There were shadows under the bank.

"This is a good spot," Frank said.

Tom began to assemble his rod. Leo watched, holding his own stiffly.

"What do I do?" Leo asked.

"You watch first," Frank said. "Then you learn."

Frank set down his gear. He took his rod. He stripped line from the reel. He let the fly hang. The sun caught the feathers.

"See the line," Frank said to Leo. "It's part of the rod. Part of you. You want it to go where you look."

He demonstrated. He cast the line with a smooth, effortless motion. The fly sailed out. It landed light as a feather. Just above the eddy. It floated down. It moved with the current. He watched it. His eyes were fixed.

"That's a good cast," Tom said.

Frank reeled in. He cast again. The line sang.

"You feel the rod," Frank said. "It loads. It unloads. It throws the line. Not your arm. The rod."

Leo tried. He held the rod like a club. He swung it. The line tangled. The fly landed with a splash.

Frank watched. He did not smile. He did not frown.

"No," he said. "Slow. Like this."

He took Leo's rod. He stood behind him. He put his hands over Leo's. He moved Leo's arms. Slowly. Back and forth. He showed him the rhythm. The pause at the top. The push forward.

"Feel that?" Frank asked. "That pull back. Then the flick. That's the rod working."

Leo tried again. He was awkward. He still muscled it. The line still tangled. But it was better. The fly landed a little softer. A little closer.

"It's about patience," Frank said. "The fish are patient. You have to be more patient."

Tom cast his own line. He caught a small trout. He unhooked it carefully. He held it in the water. Then he let it go. It darted away.

"Why let it go?" Leo asked.

"They're not hungry today," Tom said. "Just feeling the hook. Good to let them go."

Frank nodded. He watched Leo.

"Try again," Frank said.

Leo cast. The line went out. Not perfect. But it was straighter. The fly touched the water. It was almost delicate.

"Good," Frank said. It was a single word. It carried weight.

Leo’s shoulders relaxed a little. He cast again. And again. The repetition was slow. It was deliberate. The air was clear. The river hummed.

Frank cast his own line. He watched his fly. He watched the current. He was focused. Everything else faded. The city. The war. The ache in his chest. It all went away. Just the river. Just the line. Just the fish.

He felt the tug. It was sharp. Quick. He set the hook. The rod bent. The reel sang. He played the fish. It fought hard. It jumped. Silver in the sun.

"Get the net, Tom," Frank said. His voice was calm.

Tom moved. He dipped the net. Frank guided the fish. A good size. A rainbow trout. Its colors were bright.

Frank unhooked it. He held it in his hands. It was firm. Alive. He looked at it.

"This one stays," he said. "For dinner."

He put it in the creel. The wicker basket hung at his side. He wiped his hands on his trousers.

Leo watched. His face was alive. "That was something," he said.

"It is," Frank said.

"Did you feel it?" Leo asked. "The fight?"

"You feel it," Frank said. "You remember it."

Leo picked up his rod. He cast again. He did it better this time. The fly drifted. He watched it with new intensity. He was no longer just learning. He was searching. For that feeling. The pull. The fight. The quiet tension.

The sun climbed higher. It warmed their backs. The mist was gone. The sky was blue. Vast. Unending.

Tom sat on a rock. He lit a cigarette. He watched Frank and Leo. He watched the river. He pulled on the cigarette. The smoke was thin in the clear air.

"It takes some getting used to," Tom said to Leo. "The quiet. After the city."

Leo nodded. He still watched his fly.

"You feel things differently here," Tom said. "The edges get softer. Or harder. Depending on what you bring with you."

Frank did not look up. He cast his line again. The fly danced on the water.

Leo’s line tightened. He pulled back. Awkwardly. Too hard.

"No, no," Frank said. He moved to Leo. "Let the rod do it. Just a little pressure. Keep the line tight."

Leo fumbled with the reel. The fish fought. It was smaller than Frank's. But it was a fish.

"You got him," Frank said. "Hold steady."

Leo pulled the fish in. It was a small brook trout. Brown and speckled. He held it with both hands. It squirmed.

"It's cold," Leo said. His voice was a gasp. "It's alive."

"It is," Frank said. He took the fish. He unhooked it quickly. He lowered it into the water. "This one goes back. You catch enough fish. You know when to keep them."

Leo watched the trout swim away. His hands felt the cold where it had been. He looked at Frank.

"You know a lot about this," Leo said.

Frank nodded. "It teaches you things," he said. "The river. The fish. The waiting."

He looked at Leo. A small line formed at the corner of Frank’s eye. It was almost a smile. A rare one.

"That's how it's done," Frank said.

Leo picked up his rod. He cast again. The line went out. It was a good cast. He watched the fly. He waited. He was learning. He was feeling. He was there.

The three men stood by the river. The sun was warm. The water ran. There was a quiet hum to things. It was a good sound.
