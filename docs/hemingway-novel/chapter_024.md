# Chapter 24
New Foundations

Frank Miller sat at the small, scarred table in the speakeasy. The light from the street was weak. It was mid-afternoon. The place was quiet. A few men sat at the bar. Frank watched them in the mirror behind the bottles. He drank his whiskey slowly. It was good whiskey.

Tom Harris came in. He walked with his usual steady gait. He carried a rolled-up newspaper in his hand.

"Frank," Tom said. He slid into the opposite chair.

"Tom," Frank said. He pushed the whiskey bottle toward him.

Tom shook his head. "Not yet. I want to show you something."

He unrolled the paper. It was a literary magazine. Not a big one. But it was a magazine. He folded it open to a specific page. He slid it across the table.

Frank looked at it. A short story. A title: "The Weight of the River." Underneath, the name: Thomas Harris.

Frank picked up the paper. He read the first paragraph. The words were plain. They were hard. They were true. It was about men. And the quiet. And the things they carried. Frank read another paragraph. He felt the river in the words. He felt the silence of the big country. He felt the things unsaid.

He put the paper down. He looked at Tom. Tom’s face was unreadable.

"They took it," Frank said. His voice was quiet.

Tom nodded. "They did."

"It's good, Tom," Frank said. "It's very good."

Tom looked out the window. The street was grey and wet. A late rain had fallen.

"It feels good to have it out," Tom said. "Like putting down a load."

"Did you tell Leo?" Frank asked.

"I called him," Tom said. "He was excited. He's been holed up. Writing his own stuff."

"He sees things," Frank said.

"Yes," Tom said. "He does. He saw us. He saw El. He saw the river. He's got a good eye for it. A good ear too."

The waiter came. Frank ordered two more whiskeys. Tom ordered a beer.

"So you're a writer now," Frank said.

Tom smiled a little. It was a tired smile. But it was there.

"I've always been a writer," Tom said. "Just never had anything to say that anyone would print. Or maybe I never knew how to say it."

He looked at Frank. "The quiet out there. It helped. It forced things out."

Frank nodded. He understood. The quiet could do that. The quiet could make you face things. Or it could make you run. Like El.

"They sent a check too," Tom said. He picked up his beer. "Not much. But it bought this round."

"You'll write more," Frank said. It was not a question.

"I think so," Tom said. He took a drink of his beer. "I have more to say. About the men. About the war. About what it did to us."

Frank looked at the wall. A peeling advertisement for a long-forgotten show.

"Some things," Frank said. "They need to be remembered."

"And some things," Tom said, "they need to be understood. If only by yourself."

Frank drank his whiskey. It warmed him. It was a good feeling. To have a friend. To have things understood without many words.

"How's the engine?" Tom asked.

"Finished," Frank said. "I ran it yesterday. Smooth. Strong."

"Good," Tom said. "That's good, Frank."

They sat in silence for a while. The speakeasy slowly filled. The talk of other men around them was a low hum. It was not the quiet of the river. But it was not the roar of the city at its worst either. It was a good sound. A sound of men living. Finding their way.

Leo sat at his small writing desk. Papers were spread everywhere. His notebook was open. It was almost full. He had started a new, larger one. Blank pages lay before him. An intimidating promise.

He bit the end of his pen. He had been working all morning. He had a stack of empty coffee cups beside him.

He was trying to capture the feeling. The raw truth. Not just the events. But what the events did to a man. What they did to Frank. To Tom. To El.

He wrote a line. He stared at it. It was not right. Too soft. Too young.

He thought of the river. The way the light cut through the mist. Frank's hands on the rod. The quiet patience. The way Frank’s eyes watched the water. Like he was looking for something that was not a fish.

He thought of El. Her quick, bright laughter. Her sharp words. The way she had run from the quiet. Saying it was a kind of death. But he knew it was not death she feared. It was the feeling of life. Of a life that hurt too much. A life that made her face the things she wanted to forget.

He thought of Tom. His steadiness. His quiet stories by the fire. The things he said between the lines. About the war. About what it did to a man's soul. About the need to write it down. To make sense of it. To make it real.

Leo crumpled the page. He threw it toward the wastebasket. It missed.

He took a deep breath. He leaned back in his chair. The springs creaked.

He looked at his reflection in the window. The city outside was a blur of motion. It had seemed so vital before Montana. So exciting. Now it seemed like a wound. A place where everyone ran. Everyone tried to forget.

He picked up a fresh sheet of paper. He wrote a new line. It was simple. It was direct. It was about a man. And a war. And a quiet search.

He smiled a little. It was better. It was closer.

He wrote another line. And another. The words began to flow. Not fast. But steady. Like the river itself.

He was not just writing what he saw now. He was writing what he felt. What he knew. What he had learned. About love. About loss. About the endless search for meaning.

He would write about Frank's engine. The one that was almost done. The one that was a piece of the sky. Grounded. He knew what that meant now. More than he had before.

He wrote on. The city noise outside faded away. He was in the cabin again. By the fire. Listening to the quiet. Watching. Learning. Finding his own truth.

***

Frank walked out toward the airfield. It was a long walk. Past the last of the warehouses. Past the factories that smelled of oil and metal.

The sun was high. It beat down on the cracked pavement. The air was dry.

He reached the wire fence. It was tall. Barbed wire at the top. Frank gripped the chain links. The metal was warm from the sun.

The airfield stretched out before him. A vast, flat plain of grass and packed dirt. Hangars lined one side. Small, squat buildings. They looked like giant birds asleep.

A biplane was taxiing. A yellow one. Small and agile. Like a dragonfly. Frank watched it. He remembered the feel of the controls. The rudder bar against his feet. The stick in his hand. The vibration in his gut.

The pilot wore a leather helmet. He waved a hand. A mechanic waved back.

The plane turned into the wind. The engine roared. A deep, throaty sound. It vibrated up Frank's arms. Into his chest. He felt the hum inside him. A familiar echo. Not of fear. Not of panic. But of power. Of control. Of elevation.

The plane began its run. Faster and faster. The wheels bounced on the uneven ground. It lifted. Slowly at first. Then cleanly. It climbed into the blue. It banked. It turned. It flew a wide, graceful circle.

Frank watched it. He watched it until it was a tiny speck. A lost button in the sky.

He thought of his own engine. Back in his apartment. It was done. He had run it for a full hour yesterday. It hummed. A perfect, steady song. He had built it. Piece by piece. Bolt by bolt. He knew every part. Every curve of the metal. Every turn of the piston.

It was not the same as flying. But it was close. It was a piece of what he had loved. Held in his hands. On solid ground.

Another plane landed. A bigger one. It rumbled down the strip. The propeller spun into a blur. Then it slowed. It stopped.

Frank watched the pilot climb out. Young. Confident. Not much older than he had been. Before.

He thought of the war. The roar of the engines in formation. The smell of gun oil. The sudden bursts of machine gun fire. The feeling of falling. The ground rushing up to meet him.

He closed his eyes for a moment. He opened them. The pain was still there. A dull, constant ache. Like an old wound. Always reminding him.

But it was not sharp now. It was not a fresh cut. It was a part of him. Like the scars on his hand.

He looked at the sky. It was wide and clear. The sun shone down. Bright and hot.

He gripped the fence. The wire was warm. The planes came and went. A steady rhythm. A pattern.

He spent another hour there. Watching. Breathing. Feeling the air. Feeling the ground.

Then he turned to leave. He walked back toward the city. The roar of the engines faded behind him.

He had the engine. He had Tom. He had the quiet memories of Montana. He had the city.

He was not flying. But he was moving. He was walking. On solid ground. The ache was there. But he knew it now. He carried it. It did not carry him.
