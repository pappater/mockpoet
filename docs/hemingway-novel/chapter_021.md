# Chapter 21
The Return Journey

Eleanor left in the morning. Mr. Jensen drove her to the train. She did not look back at the cabin. She did not say goodbye to Frank. He watched the truck go down the dirt track. It raised dust. Then the dust settled. The quiet came back. It felt different now.

Frank went inside. He packed his things. Tom packed his. Leo packed his notebook carefully. The cabin felt too large with her gone.

They walked down to the road. Mr. Jensen would pick them up in an hour. The river ran cold and fast. The sun was high.

"She always runs," Tom said. He said it to the river.
Frank did not answer. He lit a cigarette. He watched the smoke go up. It got lost in the clear air.

Leo sat on a rock. He held his notebook. He watched the river.

Mr. Jensen arrived. His truck was old. It smelled of hay and dust. They put their bags in the back. Frank got in the front with Mr. Jensen. Tom and Leo got in the back. The truck started. It bounced on the road.

They drove in silence. The mountains stood tall. The sky was wide. Frank looked at the road. He looked at the mountains. He looked at the sky.

At the station, the train waited. It was a long train. The engine was black. Steam came out. The platform was busy. People got on. They said goodbye.

They found their car. It was almost empty. There were four seats in their compartment. One was empty. It was the one El had taken on the way out.

Tom put his bag on the rack. Frank put his up. Leo did the same. They sat down. Frank took the window seat. Tom sat opposite him. Leo sat next to Frank. The whistle blew. The train lurched. It began to move.

The town went by. The houses got smaller. The fields opened up. The mountains moved away.

Leo pulled out his notebook. He looked at the pages. He had written much.

Frank watched the landscape. It went fast. The trees were green. The sky was blue. Clouds were white.

"You wrote a lot, kid," Tom said.
Leo nodded. "Yes."
"What did you write?" Tom asked.
Leo looked at his notebook. He looked at the window. "Things. What I saw."
"Read some of it," Tom said.

Leo hesitated. He cleared his throat. He held the notebook steady.

"Go ahead," Frank said. His voice was quiet. He did not look at Leo. He looked out the window.

Leo began to read. His voice was low at first. Then it got stronger.

"The cabin stood by the river. The river ran clean. There were fish in the river. Rainbows. Browns."

He paused. He looked at them. Tom nodded. Frank did not move.

Leo continued. "He taught me to cast. The line went out. It made a curve. The fly landed soft. It was good to feel the rod. It was good to feel the pull."

He turned a page.

"She was loud in the cabin. She did not like the quiet. The quiet made her restless. It brought things up. Things she did not want to see."

He stopped again. His eyes found Frank's reflection in the window. Frank watched the fields.

"She talked of the war. She said it took things. It made her run. She could not stay still. She ran from herself. She ran from what was there."

Leo's voice was steady. He read what he had seen.

"He sat quiet. He watched her. His face was still. He did not speak much. He had the quiet inside him. The war put it there. It was a quiet ache."

Tom listened. His eyes were on Leo. Then they went to Frank.

Leo turned another page. "He cleaned the reel. He cleaned it slow. He made it perfect. It was a way to make things solid. A way to hold on. The ache was there. He did not speak of it."

"She left," Leo read. "She said the quiet was a kind of death. She said she needed noise. She needed people. She left alone. The seat is empty now."

Leo closed the notebook. He looked at Tom. He looked at Frank.

"It's good, kid," Tom said. "You got a lot down."

Frank moved his head slightly. He looked at Leo. His eyes were steady. They did not blink.
"You see a lot, kid," Frank said. His voice was flat. It was not a question. It was a statement.

Leo nodded. He felt the truth of it. He had seen much. He had written it down.

The train rushed on. The fields turned to small towns. The light began to fade. The sun started to go down. It was a big sun. It made the sky orange and red.

Frank watched it. He watched it until it was gone. The sky turned gray. The stars began to come out.

Tom pulled out a flask. He took a drink. He offered it to Frank. Frank took it. He drank. He handed it back.

"Long way back," Tom said.
"Yes," Frank said.

Leo looked out his window. He watched the dark pass. He thought of the words in his notebook. He had captured something. He knew it.

He wondered what Frank was thinking. He knew Frank was thinking of something. He did not know what. He knew Frank would not say.

The train kept moving. The rhythm was steady. It was a good rhythm. It was a rhythm of going somewhere.
