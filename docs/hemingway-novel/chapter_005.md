# Chapter 5
A Morning After

The room was grey. Light pushed through the window. Frank lay still. His head hurt. The taste in his mouth was bad. He moved his tongue. It felt thick.

He sat up. The bed creaked. He swung his legs over the side. The floor was cold. He stood. His joints felt stiff. He walked to the small table by the window.

On the table lay his pilot’s goggles. The leather was worn. The lenses were dull. He picked them up. He felt their weight. He ran his thumb over the strap.

He walked to the sink. He turned the tap. Water ran cold. He splashed it on his face. The cold stung. It woke him a little. He dried his face with a rough towel.

He looked at the goggles again. He went to a drawer. He pulled out a soft cloth. He sat on the single chair. He held the goggles in his hands. He began to clean them.

He worked slowly. He wiped the leather. He rubbed the lenses. He saw the dust come off. The glass began to shine. He looked through them. The room looked different. It looked small. It looked far away.

He remembered the sky. He remembered the air. He remembered the wind. It was a long time ago. He put the goggles down. He folded the cloth. He put it back in the drawer.

He stood. He walked to the small stove. He filled a kettle with water. He put it on the burner. He lit the gas. The flame was blue.

He found coffee grounds. He spooned them into the pot. He waited for the kettle. It began to whistle. A thin sound. He poured the hot water. The coffee smelled strong.

The door opened. Eleanor stood there. She held a small handbag. Her dress was rumpled. Her hair was loose. She looked tired. She closed the door quietly.

"Morning, Miller," she said. Her voice was rough.
Frank looked at her. He said nothing.
She walked into the room. She dropped her bag on the floor. It made a soft thud.
"Coffee?" she asked.
Frank nodded. He poured two cups. He pushed one across the small table.
She sat down. She picked up the cup. She took a long drink. She made a sound. It was not a happy sound.
"Rough night," she said.
Frank did not answer. He watched her.
She set the cup down. She looked at the goggles on the table. They gleamed.
"Still clinging to the sky, Miller?" she asked. Her voice was flat.
Frank grunted. He picked up his coffee. He drank from it.
"You still fly?" she asked.
"No," Frank said.
"No," she repeated. "Right."
She looked around the small apartment. Her eyes moved over the bare walls. Over the single bed.
"You keep it simple," she said.
"It works," Frank said.
"Does it?" she asked.
Frank looked at her. His face was still.
She ran a hand through her hair. "God, my head."
"Eat something," Frank said.
"No appetite," she said. "Just coffee."
She took another drink. She watched Frank.
"You left last night," she said.
"Yes," Frank said.
"Too loud?" she asked.
"Too much," he said.
"It was fun," she said. She looked away. "For a while."
She turned back to him. "Did Tom leave with you?"
"No," Frank said. "He stayed."
"Of course," she said. "He always stays. Tom is steady."
She picked at a loose thread on her dress.
"I saw Jimmy," she said.
Frank looked at his coffee cup.
"He asked about you," she said.
"What about?" Frank asked. His voice was low.
"He wondered where you went," she said. "From the club. He said he hadn't seen you around."
Frank said nothing.
"He wanted to know if you were still working on that engine," she said.
"He knows I am," Frank said.
"He just asked," El said. Her tone was light. Too light.
She took a deep breath. She finished her coffee.
"I need more," she said.
Frank poured her another cup. He poured one for himself.
"You always smell of coffee in the mornings," she said. "And something else. Something clean."
Frank took a slow drink.
She looked at the goggles again. She reached out. Her finger touched the leather.
"These saw a lot," she said.
Frank nodded.
"You miss it, don't you?" she asked. "The flying."
"Some things," he said.
"The height," she said. "The speed. The way you could just leave everything behind."
"Yes," Frank said.
"It must have been something," she said. "To be up there. Looking down."
"It was," Frank said.
She pulled her hand back. She picked up her cup again.
"I wish I had something like that," she said. "Something that made me feel so… solid."
Frank looked at her. Her eyes were tired. There was a faint smudge under one.
"You have things," he said.
"What things, Miller?" she asked. A small, bitter laugh came out. "Men? Drinks? A new city every month?"
Frank did not answer. He watched the steam rise from his coffee.
"None of it sticks," she said. "It all just… goes away."
She looked out the window. Down at the street. The sounds of the city began to rise. A horn. A faraway shout.
"Last night was a blur," she said. "I danced. I drank. I said things."
Frank waited.
"I probably said too much," she said. "To Jimmy. To anyone who would listen."
"What did you say?" Frank asked.
She shook her head. "Does it matter? It's gone now. Blown away with the smoke."
She turned back to him. Her eyes were sharp.
"You don't forget, do you?" she asked.
"No," Frank said. "I don't forget."
"The war," she said. "The things before the war. You hold onto all of it."
Frank looked at her. He saw the pain in her eyes. It was a familiar pain.
"Someone has to," he said.
She looked down at her hands. She twisted a ring on her finger.
"I can't," she said. Her voice was quiet. "I try. I try very hard not to."
"I know," Frank said.
She looked up quickly. "You know?"
"Yes," he said.
"It’s easier to just move," she said. "To keep moving. Then nothing can catch you."
"Nothing can catch you for long," Frank said.
She smiled. It was a sad smile. "You sound like Tom."
"He's right," Frank said.
She finished her second cup. She stood. She picked up her handbag.
"I should go," she said.
Frank stood too.
"I'm meeting someone," she said. "For lunch."
"Who?" Frank asked.
She shrugged. "Just someone. From last night."
Frank nodded slowly.
She walked to the door. She stopped. She turned.
"You’ll be here?" she asked.
"Yes," Frank said.
"Still fixing that engine?" she asked.
"Yes," he said.
"Still cleaning those goggles?" she asked.
He did not answer. He looked at the goggles on the table.
She looked at him. Her eyes were unreadable. Then she opened the door.
"Goodbye, Miller," she said.
"Goodbye, El," Frank said.
She stepped out. The door closed. The room was quiet again.
Frank walked to the table. He picked up the goggles. He held them in his hands. He looked at the light coming through the window. It hit the lenses. It made them gleam. He stood there for a long time. The coffee grew cold in the pot.
