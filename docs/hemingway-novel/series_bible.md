## 3. Core Themes

**Primary Theme: Love, loss, and the search for meaning in post-war America.**
*   **Manifestation:** Frank cannot fully connect. El cannot stay. The shadow of the war touches all their lives. They seek meaning in drink, in work, in each other, and in the quiet of the wild. Nature offers temporary truth.

**Secondary Themes:**
*   **Disillusionment:** The war took old beliefs. What is left?
    *   **Manifestation:** Characters doubt old ways. Cynicism. A new, harder view of life.
*   **Masculinity and Trauma:** How men carry invisible war wounds.

*   **The Nature of Love:** Can it last? Can it heal? Is it just escape?
    *   **Manifestation:** Frank and El's difficult connection. Other, simpler liaisons. Love as a fleeting comfort.
*   **The Search for Authenticity:** In a fast, loud world, what is real?
    *   **Manifestation:** The draw of the wilderness. Honest dialogue. Stripping away pretense.

## 4. Tone and Style Guidelines

*   **Prose:** Minimalist. Direct. Short sentences. Simple words.
*   **Dialogue:** Heavy use. Characters speak plainly. Much is said between the lines.
*   **"Iceberg Theory":** Show only the surface. The deeper meaning, emotion, and context are implied. Never state outright what a character feels.
*   **Focus:** Action and dialogue drive the story. Internal thought is rare, shown through external behavior.
*   **Emotion:** Understated. Avoid sentimentality. Emotion is a tight line, a shared glance, a hand on a glass, not a declaration.

## 5. Story World Rules

*   **Constraints:**
    *   **Prohibition:** Alcohol is illegal. Speakeasies are common. This shapes social interaction and character choices.
    *   **War's Shadow:** WWI left its mark on everyone. Physical and psychological scars are common.
    *   **Travel and Communication:** Slower. Trains are key. Telephones are less common. Letters are important.
*   **Cultural/Historical Context:**
    *   **"Lost Generation":** A pervasive feeling of being adrift, of questioning old values. Characters live with this spirit.
    *   **Jazz Age:** A time of new freedoms. Jazz music and flapper culture are present, but often viewed with a jaded eye by the veterans.
    *   **Economic Boom:** A veneer of prosperity covers underlying anxieties and the harsh realities of those struggling.
    *   **Urbanization:** The pull of the city is strong, but the wild places offer a different kind of truth.
