# Chapter 18
Leo's Awakening

The cabin was quiet. Light came through the single pane window. Leo woke first. He lay on his cot. The air was cold on his face. He watched the dust motes dance in the shaft of sun. Frank was on his cot. Tom was still asleep too. El’s cot was empty.

Leo got up. He went to the window. The river moved outside. The mountains were still. There was a mist over the water. It was cold. He rubbed his arms.

He went to the small table. His notebook was there. He picked it up. His pen felt heavy. He sat down. He looked at the blank page. He wanted to write. He wanted to write what he saw. He wanted to write what he felt. He had seen much.

He wrote a line. He looked at it. It was too long. It was too soft. He crumpled the page. He threw it on the floor.

El came in from outside. Her hair was tangled. She wore a heavy sweater. She did not look at Leo. She went to the stove. She put the kettle on.

“Cold out,” she said. Her voice was rough.

Leo watched her. She moved fast. She always moved fast. He thought of her words yesterday. *Everything good ends in pain.* He wrote that in his head.

She poured water for coffee. The steam rose. She looked out the window. Her eyes were hard. She looked at nothing. She looked at everything.

Tom stirred. He sat up. He rubbed his face.

“Morning,” Tom said. He looked at Leo. He looked at El.

El just grunted. She drank her coffee. She held the mug with both hands.

Frank coughed from his cot. He sat up. He looked at them. His eyes were clear. He looked at El. He looked at Leo.

“Coffee’s hot,” El said. She did not look at Frank.

Leo watched Frank. He remembered the eagle. He remembered the snap of the line. The fear. The ache. Frank did not show it. He never showed it. He just moved. He put on his boots. He went to the stove. He poured his coffee.

Leo wrote in his notebook. He wrote: *She moves. He watches. They drink coffee.* He read it. It was better. It was not enough.

El finished her coffee. She put the mug down hard. “I’m going for a walk,” she said.

Tom looked at her. “Alone?”

“Always,” she said. She grabbed her coat. She went out. The door shut.

Frank watched the door. Then he looked at Leo. “Writing?” he asked. His voice was flat.

Leo nodded. “Trying to.”

“What about?” Frank asked. He took a sip of his coffee.

“Things,” Leo said. He did not know how to say it. *About all of it.*

Tom laughed. A short, dry sound. “Always things to write about. Especially out here.”

“Out here is different,” Leo said. He looked at Frank. He looked at Tom.

“It is,” Frank said. He drank more coffee.

Leo looked at his notebook. He wrote: *The quiet is loud here. It makes them talk. Or not talk.* He liked that. He liked it better.

He thought about El. Her quick movements. Her sharp words. Her easy laugh with the rancher. Ben. He had seen it from the river. Frank had seen it too. Frank’s jaw had tightened. He remembered that. He wrote it. *His jaw tightened.*

He thought about Tom. Tom’s words by the fire. *The war moved inside them.* *Things that change a man.* *Not just the bullets.* Leo looked at Tom. Tom was looking out the window now. He saw the mountains. He saw the river. What did Tom see? Leo did not know. He only saw what Tom did.

“We should fish today,” Tom said. He turned from the window. He looked at Frank.

Frank nodded. “Good.”

Leo closed his notebook. He put the pen inside. He wanted to write more. But he needed to watch. He needed to see.

They ate some bread and dried meat. It was quiet. Frank cleaned his reel. Tom sharpened a hook. Leo watched them. Their movements were sure. They were men who knew what they were doing. They were men who had known other things too.

El did not come back. They waited. The sun rose higher. It warmed the cabin.

“She’ll be back,” Tom said. “Eventually.”

Frank said nothing. He tightened a screw on his reel.

Leo thought about El. Her words yesterday. *I can’t stay close. Especially not you.* Her fear. He saw it now. It was not anger. It was fear. Fear of the pain. Fear of the loss. He wrote that in his head. *Fear of the loss.*

He took his notebook out again. He opened it. He drew a line. A straight, hard line. Like the horizon. Like the river.

He wrote: *She runs. From the quiet. From the sticking things.*

He looked up. Frank was watching him. Frank’s eyes were flat. They gave nothing. They took nothing. Frank looked at the page.

“Words,” Frank said.

“Yes,” Leo said.

Frank nodded. He went back to his reel.

Leo saw Frank’s hand. The strong fingers. The scars. He knew they were war scars. He knew Frank remembered the sky. He remembered the crash. The snap of the line. The things that stay.

He wrote: *He remembers the sky. The ache is a hum.*

Tom stood up. He stretched. “Ready?”

Frank nodded. He put his reel in his bag.

“I’ll stay here,” Leo said. “Today.”

Tom looked at him. “Alright. See you at dinner.”

Frank nodded again. He did not speak. He picked up his rod. He went out the door. Tom followed him. The door shut again.

Leo was alone. He heard the river. He heard the wind. He heard nothing else. It was the loud quiet.

He opened his notebook. He thought about the men. He thought about El. He thought about the war. It had broken things. It had made new things.

He wrote: *The war took their old beliefs. What is left? A search. For solid ground. For feeling alive.*

He wrote about El. *She wants to feel alive. But she runs from the things that would make her feel. She fears the pain. The loss.* He saw her in his mind. Her red dress. Her quick laugh. Her hard eyes. Her empty hands.

He wrote about Frank. *He holds on. To the memory of the sky. To the engine. To the silence. He searches for peace in the steady things. The river. The cast of the line.* Leo thought about Frank’s quiet acceptance of El’s departure. *I know,* Frank had said. He had known. He always knew.

He wrote about Tom. *He carries their burden. He tries to make sense of it. With words. With whiskey. He is the anchor.*

Leo looked at the page. It was full. It was honest. He had not used big words. He had not used soft words. He had written what he saw. What he felt. Not his feelings. Their feelings. He had shown them.

He read the words again. He did not crumple this page. He kept it. He put his pen down. He looked out the window. The mountains were still there. The river moved. The sun was higher.

His gaze was different now. The world was not simple. It was hard. It was beautiful. It was full of loss. It was full of search. He saw it. He understood it. He was not naive. Not anymore. He was a writer. He saw. He wrote. It was all he could do. He would keep writing. He would write the truth. The raw truth. He knew it now.
