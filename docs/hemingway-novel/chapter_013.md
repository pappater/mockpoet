# Chapter 13
A Different Kind of Connection

The morning was clean. El walked away from the cabin. The sun was high. It felt hot on her face. The quiet of the place was still too much. It pushed at her. The silence made her skin prickle. She walked down the path, past the turn to the river. The dust rose around her shoes.

She had slept badly. The words from last night were still in the air. Frank's silence. Her own words. They hung heavy. She did not want to think of them. She wanted to walk and not think.

She walked for a long time. The path turned into a track. It led past some scrub pines. She saw a fence line ahead. A man was working there. He was mending the fence. He wore a wide hat and dusty trousers. His shirt was open at the neck.

She kept walking towards him. He straightened up when she was closer. He took off his hat. He had a tanned face. His eyes were direct.

"Morning," he said. His voice was slow.

"Morning," El said. "Working hard?"

"Always something," he said. He put his hat back on. "Haven't seen you around here before."

"We're staying upriver," El said. "Fishing."

"Ah," he said. He nodded. "The fishing's good this time of year."

She stood there for a moment. The sun was hot. The man waited. He did not say more. He was simple. It was good.

"It's quiet out here," El said.

"It is," he said. "Good quiet, most times."

El smiled. "Sometimes it's too quiet."

The man looked at her. He saw something. "City folk often find it so."

"I am city folk," she said.

He grinned. It was a pleasant grin. "I guessed as much." He wiped his hands on his trousers. "You look thirsty. I've got a canteen."

"I wouldn't say no," El said.

He went to a saddlebag slung over the fence. He pulled out a heavy canvas canteen. He unscrewed the top. He offered it to her.

El took a long drink. The water was cool. It tasted of canvas. It was good.

"Thanks," she said. She handed it back.

He drank some too. "You staying long?"

"Don't know," she said. "It depends."

"On what?" he asked.

"On me, mostly," she said. She looked down the track. It went on and on.

He nodded. "That's how it is." He leaned against the fence post. "Name's Ben. Ben Carter."

"Eleanor Vance," she said. "But everyone calls me El."

"El," he repeated. He liked the sound of it.

"So, you work this land?" she asked.

"My family's land," he said. "For three generations. We ranch cattle."

"That sounds solid," El said. She thought of Frank. He wanted solid ground. This man had it.

Ben shrugged. "It's work. Hard work. But it's honest."

"Honest," she said. "That's something."

She looked at his hands. They were strong hands. They were rough. They knew how to work.

"You want to rest a bit?" Ben asked. "Sun's getting high. Not good for walking."

"I could," she said. "I like to talk."

"I don't talk much," Ben said. "But I listen well enough."

El laughed. It was an easy laugh. "That's a good quality, Ben."

He smiled again. "It serves."

They stood there for a while. The sun beat down. The wind moved the tall grass. They talked about the land. About the cattle. About the long winters. Ben spoke slowly. His words were few. But they were good words. El found herself listening. She did not have to fill the silences. He was comfortable with them.

"You got anything stronger than water, Ben?" she asked after a while.

He looked at her. "I might. For medicinal purposes, you understand." He winked.

"I understand," she said. "My nerves are shot, maybe."

He chuckled. He reached into the saddlebag again. He pulled out a small, flat flask. It was metal. It was old. He unscrewed the top. He offered it to her.

"Careful now," he said. "It's homemade. Good stuff, though."

El took a sniff. It was whiskey. Strong whiskey. Raw.

She took a swallow. It burned going down. It was rough. It was good.

"That's some medicine," she said, her eyes watering a little.

"It cures what ails you," Ben said. "For a time, anyway."

She took another drink. It warmed her stomach. It quieted the restlessness. For a moment.

"Thanks, Ben," she said. "That's better."

He took a drink too. "Glad to help."

They talked more. Ben asked her about the city. She spoke of the speed. The noise. The lights. He listened without judgment. He just listened. It was different from Tom. Different from Frank. They listened too. But they always saw more. They always knew. Ben just took the words.

She found herself telling him about the war. Not about what she saw. She spoke of the feeling it left. The way it changed everything. The way nothing felt real anymore.

He nodded slowly. "My brother went," he said. "Never came back the same. Went East, disappeared."

El looked at him. There was understanding in his eyes. A simple, direct understanding. No analysis. No pity. Just knowing.

She took another drink from the flask. Ben did not rush her. He did not ask questions. He just watched the horizon.

Far off, by the river, Frank was fishing. He had been there since early morning. The sun was climbing. His cast was smooth. It was a good rhythm. He liked the rhythm. It kept his mind steady.

He had caught a few small ones. He put them back. He was not hungry. He just liked the act. The line, the water, the quiet pull. It was good.

He looked up from the river. He saw El in the distance. She was standing by the fence line. A man was with her. He saw her laugh. He saw her raise something to her mouth. A flask.

He watched for a moment. The man was big. He wore a hat. He looked like a ranch hand. A local.

Frank watched them talk. He watched El's head tilt. He watched her smile. He watched the easy way she stood there.

He looked back at the river. The line was slack. He pulled it in. He re-cast. The fly hit the water. He watched it drift. He felt the river flow.

He thought of the city. He thought of El. He thought of the war. He thought of the sky.

His grip tightened on the rod. A muscle in his jaw moved. The line stretched. He watched the fly. It was a good fly. He had tied it himself. It was a habit. A good habit.

He felt a tug. A sharp, sudden tug. He pulled back. The rod bent. It was a strong fish. He worked the reel. The fish fought. It jumped once. A flash of silver in the sun.

He brought it in slowly. It was a rainbow trout. A big one. He landed it carefully. He held it in his hands. It was cold. It thrashed once. Then it was still.

He looked at the fish. He thought of El. He thought of the man by the fence. He thought of the sun. It was hot. The air was still.

He unhooked the fish. He held it in the water. It swam off with a flick of its tail. He watched it go. He watched the ripples spread. Then he cast again. The line sang through the air.
