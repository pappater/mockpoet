# Chapter 12
Night in the Cabin

The cabin was warm from the fire. Outside, the dark pressed close. A kerosene lantern sat on the table. Its light was soft.

Tom put down a plate of trout. He had cooked it over the fire. It smelled good.

“Eat,” he said.

Frank took a piece. He put it on his plate. Leo took some too. Eleanor looked at the fish. She picked at it with her fork.

“Simple fare,” she said. “Very rustic.”

Nobody answered her. They ate. The fish was firm.

“Good fish, Tom,” Frank said.

Tom nodded. “The river gives.”

Leo ate slowly. He watched Frank. Then he watched El.

Eleanor took a drink from her glass. It was whiskey, straight. She did not eat much of the fish.

“Still quiet, Frank,” she said. Her voice was too loud.

Frank looked at the fire. He moved a log with his boot. Sparks flew up the chimney.

“Nothing to say,” he said.

“Always something to say,” El said. “Just not to us.”

She smiled. It was not a warm smile.

“What do you talk about when you are alone?” she asked. “To the river? To your engine?”

Frank took another bite of fish. He chewed it slowly.

“He talks to his thoughts,” Tom said. He looked at El. His eyes were flat.

Eleanor ignored Tom. She leaned forward. Her eyes were bright.

“Still flying, Frank?” she asked. “In your head? Still in the clouds?”

Frank picked up his glass. He drank. The glass was empty. He put it down. A muscle twitched in his jaw.

“Sometimes,” he said. His voice was low.

“It’s a long way down,” El said. She laughed. The sound was sharp in the small cabin.

Leo shifted in his seat. He looked at Tom. Tom shook his head slightly.

“The air is good here,” Tom said. “Clean. We should fish more tomorrow.”

Eleanor waved a hand. “Fish. Always fish. Isn’t there anything else?”

“There’s the quiet,” Leo said. He spoke softly.

Eleanor looked at him. Her eyes narrowed. “The quiet? What does the quiet tell you, Leo?”

Leo looked down at his plate. He put his fork down.

“It tells you things,” he said. “Different things.”

“Like what?” El pushed.

“Like how loud the city was,” Leo said.

Eleanor scoffed. “The city is alive. This is… empty.”

Frank stood up. He walked to the window. The glass was cold. He looked out at the dark.

“Not empty,” he said. His voice was distant. “Just different.”

Eleanor drank again. She watched Frank’s back.

“Different,” she repeated. “Always different. Always somewhere else, even when you’re here.”

Frank turned from the window. He looked at El. His face showed nothing.

“You came here,” he said.

“And I am bored,” she said. “Terribly bored. There is nothing to do. Nothing to see. Just trees and water and men who stare into fires.”

Tom stood too. He went to the small cupboard. He got out another bottle of whiskey. He poured Frank a drink. He poured one for himself. He looked at El’s empty glass. He did not offer her a refill.

“We came to fish,” Tom said. “To breathe. To get away from things.”

“From me?” Eleanor asked. Her voice was thin.

Tom poured his whiskey. He looked at El.

“From the city,” he said. “From the noise. From all the things that do not stick.”

Eleanor slammed her glass down on the table. It made a loud noise.

“Nothing sticks for me,” she said. “You know that. Nothing ever did. The war made sure of that.”

Frank did not speak. He watched the whiskey in his glass.

“But Frank has his war,” El continued. “His beautiful war in the sky. He has his engine. His goggles. His memories. What do I have, Frank?”

Frank raised his eyes. He met her gaze. He said nothing.

“Tell me,” she said. “Tell me what I have. Tell me why I am here, in this… this wilderness. With nothing.”

“You have your choices,” Frank said. His voice was flat.

Eleanor laughed again. It was a broken sound. “Choices. Yes. Always choices. And I always choose wrong, don’t I?”

She stood up. She walked to the other side of the cabin. She stood with her back to them. Her shoulders shook.

Leo watched her. His pen hovered over his notebook. He did not write.

Tom finished his whiskey. He put the glass down.

“The night is getting late,” Tom said. “We have an early start tomorrow.”

He looked at Frank. Frank nodded. He set his own glass down. He did not look at Eleanor.

Eleanor turned around. Her eyes were red. Not from crying. From something else. Something hard.

“Goodnight, then,” she said. Her voice was tight.

She walked past them. She went to her cot. She lay down. She faced the wall.

Frank sat back at the table. He looked at the fish bones on his plate. He picked up his glass again. It was empty. He looked at the fire. The flames danced. The cabin was quiet. The silence was thick. It was not the quiet of the river. It was the quiet of things unsaid.
