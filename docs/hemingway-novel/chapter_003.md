# Chapter 3
New Faces, Old Scars

The door opened and closed. A man came in. He was young. Tom waved him over. Frank watched.

"Frank," Tom said. "This is Leo. Leo, Frank Miller."

Leo was clean-cut. His suit was new. He had bright eyes. He extended a hand. Frank shook it. Leo's grip was firm.

"Glad to meet you, Mr. Miller," Leo said. "Tom has told me a lot."

Frank nodded. He did not say anything. He took a sip of his drink.

"Leo just finished college," Tom said. "Full of questions. Full of everything."

Leo smiled. "It's a new world, isn't it?" he said. "Everything feels different."

Eleanor laughed. It was a short, sharp sound. "It always feels different, kid," she said. "You just notice it now."

She looked at Leo. Her eyes moved over him. He was young. He was innocent.

"You weren't in it, were you?" El asked. "The war."

Leo shook his head. "No," he said. "Too young. I wanted to go. I tried to enlist. But it was over."

"Lucky you," El said. She took a long drink. The glass was empty. She signaled the waiter.

"I read about it," Leo said. He looked at Frank. "The pilots. That must have been something. The sky. The fights."

Frank looked at his glass. The ice was melting. It made a small sound.

"It was just flying," Frank said. His voice was flat.

"He was the best," Tom said. Quietly. "He flew well."

"I can only imagine," Leo said. His eyes were wide. "The courage. The danger. What it must have been like."

Eleanor leaned forward. Her voice was low now. Hard. "It was loud, kid," she said. "It was dirty. And it took things. It took a lot of things."

Leo looked from her to Frank. Frank did not look up. He watched the surface of the whiskey.

"Some things you just don't talk about, kid," Tom said. His voice was steady. He put a hand on Leo's arm. "You learn that."

Leo nodded. He looked down at his own drink. He seemed to understand. Or he thought he did.

The waiter brought El a fresh drink. She took it. She held the cold glass.

"I saw Jimmy yesterday," El said. Her voice was light. Too light. She looked at Frank.

Frank did not move. His eyes stayed on the glass.

"Oh?" Tom said. He looked at El. He did not like Jimmy.

"Yes," El said. She smiled. It did not reach her eyes. "He was asking about you, Frank. Wondered why you weren't at the club."

Frank did not speak.

"He said you missed a good time," El continued. "He said you should have been there. We had a time."

Her words hung in the air. Frank’s jaw tightened. A muscle jumped in his cheek. He picked up his glass. He drank slowly.

"He's a fool," Tom said. He said it to El. But he looked at Frank.

El shrugged. "Maybe," she said. "He knows how to dance. And he buys good whiskey."

She watched Frank. He did not look at her. He put his glass down.

"Some people," Leo began. He stopped. He did not know what to say.

"Some people like to talk," El said. She looked at Leo. "They like to say things."

"Is that all?" Tom asked El. His voice was flat.

El took another drink. "Is that all what, Tom?" she asked.

"Is that all there is to it?" Tom said.

She did not answer him directly. She looked at Frank again. Still Frank did not look at her. He looked past her. He looked at the wall.

"You know how it is," El said. "Things happen. They happen fast. You don't think about them."

Frank’s hand was on the table. It was still. His knuckles were white.

"What do you mean, El?" Leo asked. He was trying to follow.

"Never mind, Leo," Tom said. He shook his head. "It's nothing for you."

El laughed again. It was the same short, sharp sound. "It's for no one, Tom," she said. "It's just for me."

She finished her drink. She stood up.

"I need to dance," she said. "I need to move."

She walked away. Her dress was red. She moved through the crowd. She went to the dance floor. She found a man. She began to dance.

Frank watched her. His eyes followed her. He saw her head back, laughing. He saw her close to the man.

"She doesn't stop, does she?" Leo asked. He watched El. His expression was a mix of fascination and confusion.

Tom took a drink. He drained his glass. "No," he said. "She does not stop."

"Is she always like that?" Leo asked. "So… restless?"

"Always," Frank said. His voice was low. Rough. It was the first time he had spoken in a while.

"The war made a lot of people restless," Tom said. He looked at Frank. Frank did not meet his gaze.

"But she wasn't in the war," Leo said. "Not like you two."

"The war touched everyone, kid," Tom said. He signaled for another round. "It touched the ones who went. And the ones who stayed. It touched the ones who loved the ones who went."

Leo was silent for a moment. He watched El. She was a bright blur on the dance floor.

"She lives fast," Leo said. "She tries to forget things."

"She tries to feel things," Frank said. He said it to his glass.

"Is that what the war did?" Leo asked. He looked at Tom. "Made people try to forget? Or made them try to feel?"

"Both," Tom said. "It depends on the person. And what they saw. And what they lost."

He did not elaborate. He just looked at Frank. Frank was still watching El. His expression was unreadable. The light caught his eyes. They looked tired.

"Some people break," Tom said. He said it slowly. "And some people keep going. And they break other things along the way."

Leo watched El. She was dancing hard. Her hair swung. She looked happy. But there was something else. Underneath. Something frantic.

"It must be hard," Leo said. "To live like that."

Frank moved his hand. He touched the rim of his glass. The glass was cool.

"It is hard," Frank said. His voice was quiet. "It is very hard."

He did not say anything more. He just watched El. The music was loud. The crowd was loud. But for Frank, there was a quiet inside him. A quiet ache. It had been there a long time. It would stay.
