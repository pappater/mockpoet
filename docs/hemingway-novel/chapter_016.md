# Chapter 16
El's Confession

The river moved. Frank sat on a flat rock. He watched the current. The sun was up. The air was cool. He had not fished. His line lay loose by his feet.

He heard steps on the bank. Slow steps. He did not turn.

El stood behind him. She did not speak. He felt her there.

He looked at the water. It was clear.

"Frank." Her voice was low. Not loud.

He nodded.

She sat on the grass beside him. She did not have her flask. Her eyes were clear. Too clear.

"You were far away yesterday," she said.

He picked up a small stone. He dropped it in the water. It made a small sound.

"I was fishing."

"No," she said. "You weren't. Not all the time."

He watched the ripples spread.

"It gets to you here," she said. "The quiet."

He said nothing.

"It makes you think," she said. "Too much."

"It does that in the city too."

"But there you can drown it out," she said. "Here, it just comes."

She looked at her hands. They lay still in her lap.

"I can't do this, Frank," she said.

He turned his head. He looked at her.

"Do what?" he asked. His voice was flat.

"This," she said. She gestured at the river. At the quiet. At them. "This closeness. This... feeling."

He watched her face. Her jaw was tight.

"It makes me afraid," she said.

"Of what?"

She looked at him then. Her eyes were wide. They held a pain. An old pain.

"Of feeling it," she said. "Of it hurting. Of losing it."

He looked back at the river. A kingfisher darted past. Blue and fast.

"Everything good ends in pain," she said. Her voice was thin. "Doesn't it? For us."

He did not answer. He thought of the war. Of the sky. Of the fall.

"I can't stay close, Frank," she said. "I just can't. To anyone. Especially not you."

He reached out his hand. Slowly. It hovered in the air between them.

She flinched. Not a big move. Just a tightening. A pull back in herself.

His hand fell. It rested on his knee.

"I'd break it," she said. Her voice was hard now. Hard and quick. "I'd break us. Like I always do. It's better this way."

"Better for who?" he asked. His voice was still flat.

She shook her head. "It just is."

He looked at the water. It kept moving. It did not stop.

"I know," he said.

Her shoulders slumped a little. Then she straightened them. She pushed herself up. Slowly.

She stood above him. She looked down. Her eyes were hard again. The pleading was gone.

"I'll go back," she said. "Tomorrow."

He did not look up. He watched the river.

"Suit yourself," he said.

She stood there for a moment. He felt her gaze. It was a weight. Then it was gone.

He heard her walk away. Her steps were faster now. He heard them fade.

He picked up his line. It was tangled. He began to work the knot. The river moved past him. It made no sound.
