# Chapter 23
A Fading Echo

Frank sat at the bar. The speakeasy was full. It was always full. Smoke hung in the air. The clatter of glasses was constant. He nursed his whiskey. The amber liquid caught the light. He watched it.

Tom came in. He nodded to Frank. Frank nodded back. Tom ordered a beer.

"Long day?" Tom asked.

"Always a long day," Frank said. He took a drink.

"Mine too," Tom said. He drank his beer. "Sterling wants more. Always wants more."

"They always do," Frank said.

"He likes the stories," Tom said. "But he wants them… more. More of everything."

"You give him what you have," Frank said.

"That's the plan," Tom said. He put his glass down. "Leo around?"

"He's writing," Frank said. "Always writing."

"Good for him," Tom said. "He sees things."

"He does," Frank said.

The barman came by. He refilled Frank’s glass without asking. Frank watched him. The barman wiped the counter.

"Busy night, Mike," Tom said.

"Always is, Mr. Harris," Mike said. "People keep drinking."

"They do," Tom said.

Mike moved down the bar. He poured drinks. He talked to a woman in a red hat.

"Heard anything?" Tom asked Frank.

Frank knew what he meant. He shook his head. "Nothing new."

"Thought not," Tom said. "It’s been a while."

Frank nodded. He looked at his glass. The ice was melting fast.

Mike came back. He placed a fresh napkin in front of Frank.

"You heard about Eleanor, Mike?" a man down the bar called out. He was loud. He had a cigar.

Mike turned. "El? What about her?"

"Heard she’s in Paris," the man said. "Living fast. Like she always does."

Frank’s hand tightened on his glass. It was a slight movement. His knuckles whitened for a moment. Then they relaxed.

Mike laughed. "Paris. Sounds about right for her." He shook his head. "Never could stay in one place, that one."

"She couldn't," the man said. He laughed.

Mike moved away again. He went to take another order. The noise of the bar filled the space.

Frank did not look at Tom. Tom did not look at Frank.

"Paris," Tom said. It was a quiet word. He drank his beer.

Frank took a slow drink of his whiskey. The taste was familiar. It burned going down.

"She always liked Paris," Frank said. His voice was low.

"She liked a lot of places," Tom said. "For a time."

Frank nodded. He looked at the reflection in the mirror behind the bar. His own face looked back. It was tired. The lights of the bar blurred around him.

He thought of the mountains. The clean air. The quiet of the river. He thought of El on the train, laughing. El on the riverbank with Ben. El, packing her city dress.

"She was good," Tom said. "In her way."

"She was," Frank said.

They sat in silence. The speakeasy was loud around them. The jazz band started a new tune. It was fast. It was loud.

Frank finished his drink. He pushed the glass forward. Mike came over.

"Another?" Mike asked.

"No," Frank said. "Not tonight." He put money on the bar.

Tom looked at him. "Going to work?"

Frank shrugged. "Maybe."

"That engine," Tom said. "Still fighting it?"

"Still fighting it," Frank said. He stood up.

"It will get there," Tom said.

"It will," Frank said. He moved to leave.

Tom watched him go. He took another drink of his beer. The band played louder.

Frank walked out onto the street. The city was always moving. Taxis honked. People laughed. The air was cool. He walked without a direction. His hands were in his pockets.

He thought of El. Paris. It was far. It was not far enough. She would be drinking. She would be dancing. She would be trying to outrun something. She always did.

He knew the pattern. He knew it well. It did not make it easier. It just made it familiar.

He passed a newsstand. The headlines were bold. The world moved on. He kept walking.

He felt the ache in his chest. It was a dull ache. It had been there a long time. It was a quiet hum, like a distant engine.

He found himself outside his apartment building. He went inside. The stairs were dark. He climbed them slowly. The key was cold in his hand.

He opened the door. The apartment was quiet. The engine was there. It waited for him. It was solid. It was still. He went to it. He put his hand on the cold metal. It was real. It was something he could fix. Something he could hold.

He looked at his hands. They were steady. They had been steady on the throttle. They had been steady on the fishing rod. They were steady now.

He thought of El’s laugh. He thought of her eyes. He thought of her voice, saying, *I can’t stay, Frank. I just can’t.*

He did not want to think of it. He wanted to work. He wanted to build. He wanted to fix.

He found his wrench. The light from the streetlamp came through the window. It made long shadows. He bent over the engine. He turned a bolt. It was tight. He turned it again. It moved. It was a small thing. It was something.

The city sounds came through the window. He heard a distant siren. He heard a door slam. He heard music from a building down the street.

He worked in silence. The engine was metal and oil. It was precise. It had a purpose. It would fly. It would fly again. He would make it fly.

He knew she would keep running. He knew he would keep working. It was how it was. It was how it had always been. The sun came up each day. You lived. You worked. You did what you could. You kept going. You did not look back too long.

He tightened another bolt. It was good. It was solid. He wiped his hands on a rag. The oil was black. He looked at it. He threw the rag aside. He stood up straight. He looked at the engine. It was almost done.

The night outside was long. He had work to do. He had to keep moving. He had to keep building. He had to keep.
