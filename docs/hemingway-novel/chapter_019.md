# Chapter 19
The Storm

The sky went dark fast. Not the slow fade of evening, but a bruise spreading over the mountains. The wind hit the cabin first. It rattled the panes of glass in the small window. Tom looked up from his book. Leo stopped writing. Frank sat by the fire, cleaning a hook with a small stone. El stood by the door, a glass in her hand.

"It's coming," Tom said.

"It is," Frank said. He did not look up.

The first drops of rain hit the roof. They were hard drops, like stones. Then the wind picked up and threw the rain against the cabin walls. The sound was a sudden roar.

El turned from the door. "God, it's loud."

She poured herself another drink. Her movements were jerky. The whiskey splashed over the rim of the glass. She did not wipe it.

"Sit down, El," Tom said.

She shook her head. "I don't like being inside when the world breaks loose."

The first thunder came then. It was a low rumble at first, then a crack that made the cabin vibrate. Leo jumped.

"Damn," El said. "It's right on top of us."

She walked to the fire, stood behind Frank. The heat from the flames did not seem to calm her. She drank the whiskey fast.

"You like this quiet, don't you, Frank?" she said. Her voice was sharp over the rain.

Frank put the stone down. He picked up another hook. "It is quiet."

"No," El said. "It's loud. The quiet is loud. It pushes things up."

She took another drink. The bottle was nearly empty.

"What things?" Frank asked. He did not look at her.

"The things you don't want to think about," she said. "The things you bury. The things that make you sit there and clean hooks when the world is breaking open."

Tom watched them. Leo looked at the fire. The cabin shook again with a louder peal of thunder.

"Some things need cleaning," Frank said.

"Like you?" El laughed. It was not a happy sound. "Still trying to clean yourself, Frank? Still trying to make it all neat?"

Frank picked up a small file. He began to sharpen the hook. The metal scraped lightly.

"You don't want to talk about it," El said. "You never do. You just sit there. Like a goddamn statue."

"There's nothing to talk about," Frank said.

"Oh, there's always something," El said. She finished her drink. She poured another. The bottle was empty now. She slammed it down on the table. "You just don't want to feel it."

"Feeling doesn't change things," Frank said.

"No," El said. "It doesn't. But it means you're alive, doesn't it?"

The wind howled. Rain lashed the window glass. The fire hissed and popped.

"I'm alive," Frank said.

"Are you?" she asked. Her voice was low now, a bitter whisper. "Or are you just waiting for something? Still waiting for the sky? Still waiting for the engine to hum again?"

Frank stopped sharpening the hook. He looked into the fire.

"I remember that hum," El said. "That hum was good. Before. When everything was still going to be good."

"That was a long time ago," Frank said.

"Yes," El said. "It was. And you still carry it. Like a goddamn burden."

She walked closer, stood almost over him. He did not move.

"What do you want from me, Frank?" she asked. Her voice was tight.

He looked up then. His eyes were flat, tired. He looked at her face, then past her, to the rain-streaked window.

"Just to be," he said.

El let out a short, bitter laugh. It was a sound full of sharp edges.

"Just to be," she repeated. "You ask so little. Or you ask everything."

She turned away, walked to the window. The cabin was dim. Tom got up and lit a lantern. Its yellow light flickered, casting long shadows.

"I can't just be, Frank," El said to the window. Her voice was small now, barely audible over the storm. "Not like that. Not in the quiet."

Frank watched her back. She stood perfectly still, looking out into the thrashing rain. Her shoulders were tight.

"You try to be," Frank said.

"I try to run," she said. She turned, her face pale in the lantern light. "That's what I do. And you know it. You always knew it."

Frank did not answer. He picked up his file again, the small scrape of metal on metal a thin sound in the roaring cabin.

"You think I want to run?" El said. "You think I want to feel like this?"

She gestured around the cabin, at the oppressive, sheltering walls.

"It just happens," she said. "The quiet comes. And then it's all too much. All the things you buried. All the things the war changed."

She paused. The thunder cracked again, closer this time, shaking the floor beneath them.

"You're like this cabin, Frank," El said. "Solid. Shut in. And I'm the goddamn storm. Always breaking against the walls. Trying to get in. Or trying to get out."

Frank set the hook down. He looked at her. He said nothing. His mouth was a tight line.

El shook her head slowly. She walked past the fire, past Tom and Leo, who watched her with quiet, open faces. She went to her cot. She sat down, pulling a blanket around her. She did not look at any of them.

The storm continued. The rain fell. The thunder rumbled in the mountains. Frank stared at the fire. Tom watched the shadows dance on the wall. Leo wrote in his notebook, his pen scratching quietly, trying to capture the sound of the storm, the feeling in the cabin. The cabin was full of unsaid things. The air was thick with them.
