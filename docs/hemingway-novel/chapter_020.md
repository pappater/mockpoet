# Chapter 20
Aftermath and Decision

The air was clean. The storm had passed. A wet silence hung over the cabin. Water dripped from the eaves. The sky was still grey, but a lighter grey. Light came in through the window, weak and thin.

Frank was already up. He sat by the dead fire. The embers were cold. He cleaned his fishing reel. His hands moved slow. Each turn was precise. The metal shone.

El was still in her bunk. She stirred. She groaned.

"Morning," Tom said. He stood by the door, looking out. The air was cool.

Frank did not answer. He turned a screw.

El sat up. Her hair was tangled. Her eyes were red. She looked at the cabin. She looked at the walls.

"It's quiet," she said. Her voice was rough.

Tom nodded. He did not look at her. He watched the dripping eaves.

El got out of her bunk. She walked to the water bucket. She splashed water on her face. It was cold. She shivered.

"Coffee," she said. "We need coffee."

Frank stood up. He walked to the stove. He pumped the primus. The hiss was loud in the quiet cabin. He put the pot on.

Leo woke. He rubbed his eyes. He looked from El to Frank. He looked at Tom. The air was heavy.

"Did it rain much?" Leo asked.

"Enough," Tom said.

The coffee boiled. Frank poured it. He handed a cup to Tom. He handed a cup to El. She took it. Her hand shook a little.

She drank. She walked to her small bag. It sat on the floor, near her bunk. She opened it. She started putting things in.

"What are you doing?" Leo asked.

El did not look at him. She folded a dress. It was not a fishing dress. It was a city dress.

"I am leaving," El said. Her voice was flat.

Frank watched her. His face showed nothing. He sipped his coffee.

Tom turned from the door. He leaned against the frame. He looked at El.

"Soon?" Tom asked.

"Today," El said. She packed fast. Her movements were sharp.

"You can't," Leo said. "We just got here."

El laughed. It was a short sound. No joy in it. "This isn't for me, kid." She put in her flask. The bottle clinked against glass.

"The quiet," Tom said. "It gets to some people."

El zipped her bag. It was small. She did not have much. "The quiet," she said. "It makes too much noise."

Frank said nothing. He watched her.

"I cannot stand it," El said. She looked at Frank. Her eyes were hard. "This waiting. This quiet. It's a kind of death."

Frank looked away. He looked at the window. The grey light was getting brighter.

"What about the fishing?" Leo asked. He looked at Frank.

Frank took a breath. He let it out slow. "There will always be fishing."

El picked up her bag. She went to the door. Tom moved aside.

"I need Jensen," she said. "To take me to town."

Tom nodded. "He comes down this way. Should be here in an hour or so."

"Good," El said. She stood in the doorway. She looked back at Frank. Her eyes softened a little. Then they hardened again. "You stay here, Frank. You like the quiet."

Frank lifted his cup. He did not speak.

"This is not a place for me," El said again. She pulled her sweater tighter. "I need the sound of people. The noise of living."

"It's a different kind of living," Tom said.

"It is too slow," El said. "It is too much like dying."

She stepped outside. She stood on the porch. The damp air hit her face. She looked at the river. It moved slow and grey. She looked at the trees. They stood still.

Frank walked to the window. He watched her. She stood there. Small against the big sky.

Leo looked at Frank. Then he looked out the window at El. He wrote something in his notebook. He wrote fast.

"She always runs," Tom said. He said it to Frank. He said it to the air.

Frank did not answer. He watched El. She walked to the edge of the porch. She looked at the river. She bent down. She picked up a small, smooth stone. She turned it in her hand. Then she threw it. It skipped once on the water. It made a small sound.

The sound was sharp in the quiet morning.

"She said it here," Leo said. He spoke to Tom. "That everything good ends in pain."

Tom nodded. "For some people, it does." He looked at Frank's back.

El turned. She looked back at the cabin. Frank was a dark shape in the window. She saw him. He saw her. There was no wave. No smile. Just the looking.

She walked away from the cabin. She walked towards the track. The mud was soft. Her steps sank a little. She did not look back.

Frank stood at the window. He watched until she was gone from sight. The grey sky started to break. A line of yellow light showed on the horizon.

Tom poured more coffee. He held out a cup to Frank. Frank turned from the window. He took the cup.

"She will be alright," Tom said.

Frank nodded. He did not speak. He drank his coffee. It was hot. It was bitter.

"She cannot stand the stillness," Leo said. He closed his notebook.

"Some people can't," Tom said. "Some need to keep moving. To keep running."

Frank looked at his hands. He looked at the clean reel. The river hummed outside the cabin. It was a low sound. A steady sound.

"Jensen will take her," Tom said. "He will see her to the station."

Frank nodded again. He sat down by the cold fire. He picked up his goggles. He polished the glass. His fingers moved slow.

The sun started to rise. It sent a shaft of pale light through the cabin door. It hit the floor. It lit up the dust motes dancing in the air.

The cabin was quiet. The air was still.
