## Chapter 1

Chapter 1 introduces Malik, the narrator, who receives a telegram at work informing him of his mother's death. The day is characterized by oppressive heat. Malik calmly corrects his boss, Monsieur Lemaire, clarifying that the deceased, Marie Benali, is actually the mother of his friend and colleague, Nadia, for whom he acts as an emergency contact, not his own mother who died years ago. Despite the mix-up and his complete lack of personal grief, Malik takes the afternoon off, his movements slow and deliberate, while the office's weak air conditioning and the scent of koshary and pipe tobacco fill the air.

The journey to the care home is a sensory experience dominated by the city's heat, the crowded bus's diesel and stale sweat, and the indifferent rhythm of urban life. Malik observes his surroundings with a detached objectivity, viewing the death as a "simple fact" that doesn't alter the world around him. At the care home, which smells of disinfectant and cloying old flowers, he finds Nadia in the viewing room, visibly grieving. Malik offers a quiet "I'm sorry" and holds her cold hand, but feels only a quiet tiredness, not sorrow, as he observes Marie Benali's serene, pale face.

Later, Malik sits with Nadia during the vigil in the chapel, surrounded by candles and the scent of lilies. He remains emotionally distant, his attention drawn instead to minute sensory details like dust motes, the gleam of the coffin's gold trim, or his own physical discomforts like hunger and the desire for a cigarette. He exhibits no grief, even when the funeral director advises him to "remember to mourn," a concept Malik doesn't seem to grasp. After the vigil, as Nadia's uncle drives them home, Malik sits silently, his mind wandering to the beach. Back in his empty apartment, he drinks water and smokes on his balcony, the city lights below him, affirming Marie Benali's death as a mere fact, like any other, reinforcing his profound emotional detachment and sensory-focused perception of reality. The chapter ends with the upcoming funeral scheduled for the next day, a future event where Malik's unique disposition will likely continue to be tested.
