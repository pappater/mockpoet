# ACT 2, SCENE 3

## The Grand Ballroom

*The Grand Ballroom is now fully decorated, a sparkling testament to Beatrice Flutterby’s desperate efforts. Crystal chandeliers gleam, white tablecloths billow, and silver service gleams on every table. A small band plays a polite, slightly upbeat classical tune. Guests, dressed in their finest, mill about, champagne flutes in hand. BUT there’s an undercurrent of tension.*

*REGINALD WORTHINGTON III stands near the main stage, conspicuously turned away from the general crowd, a silk scarf artfully (but unconvincingly) draped over his head. He keeps adjusting it, occasionally peeking out from under it. Without his toupee, his bald head is surprisingly shiny. CLAUDIA UPPINGTON, radiating an air of smug superiority, hovers nearby, her tiny dog, PETUNIA, peeking out of her ornate purse. VALENTINA "VAL" SHARP, still in her catering uniform, circulates with a tray of exotic canapés, her small notepad subtly clutched in her hand. CHESTER BLUFF, as "Count von Geldberg," stands a little too close to the champagne fountain, regaling a small group of easily impressed guests with wildly gesticulating hands and a fluctuating accent. PENELOPE PRIM watches from a slight distance, a dry smirk playing on her lips. MARCUS FUMBLE, looking harried, attempts to direct a group of actual caterers who seem determined to ignore him. FREDERICK "FREDDY" MONTAGUE, dressed simply, leans against a pillar, enjoying a glass of champagne, still mistaken for staff.*

BEATRICE
*(Darts across the stage, clipboard clutched to her chest, nearly colliding with a waiter carrying a tower of champagne glasses)*
No! No, no, no! Those aren’t the artisanal truffle parmesan straws! Those are the… the regular parmesan sticks! We agreed on *artisanal*! This is a disaster! A five-star catastrophe!

FREDDY
*(Calmly, taking a sip)*
Seems like a pretty good stick to me, Beatrice. Very parmesan-y.

BEATRICE
*(Without looking at him, assuming he’s staff)*
Oh, for heaven’s sake, not you too, Jeffrey! Focus! We have dignitaries! And a voting! And… *Reginald!*

*She points a trembling finger towards REGINALD. He flinches, pulling the scarf tighter around his head.*

REGINALD
*(Muttering, to himself)*
Dignity, Reginald, dignity. It’s merely a *fashion statement*. A bold, avant-garde decision to embrace the… the minimalist aesthetic of the cranium. Yes.

CLAUDIA
*(Loud enough to be heard)*
Some fashion statements are best left in the attic, darling. Or perhaps under a *hat*. A very large, opaque hat. Petunia, darling, mummy’s little gossip columnist, do you see the state of affairs? Utterly bald-faced.

*PETUNIA lets out a tiny, high-pitched yap from the purse.*

CHESTER
*(To his impressed audience, with a sudden, booming Russian accent)*
And so, my ancestral home, Castle Geldberg, built entirely from granite and the tears of a thousand serfs, stands to this day! A monument to… *gravitas*! Ah, my fiancée, Valya! Come, my little blini! Join us!

VAL
*(Forcing a smile, approaching with canapés)*
Count. Madam. Gentlemen. More truffle oil infused quail egg? I believe Beatrice mentioned them being… particularly *artisanal*.

*She glances at BEATRICE, who is now wrestling with a rogue balloon arrangement.*

PENELOPE
*(Approaching Val quietly)*
Still taking notes, Val? Or are those your wedding vows to the Count of the Shifting Accents?

VAL
*(Sotto voce, showing her the tiny notepad)*
Just documenting the *gravitas*, Penelope. And trying to keep my exposé from becoming part of the hors d’oeuvres. I think I just saw Chester try to pass off a plastic pearl as a family heirloom.

PENELOPE
I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to sell Petunia as a rare breed of miniature yak.

MARCUS
*(Rushing up to Reginald, tripping slightly over his own feet)*
Mr. Worthington! Splendid news! I’ve re-organized the *entire* serving rotation to ensure maximum campaign exposure! The quail eggs are now exclusively offered by servers wearing your campaign buttons!

REGINALD
*(Peeking out from under the scarf, eyes wide)*
Marcus! What about my speech? Is it safe? Untouched? Un-compromised by… by *unnecessary exposure*?

MARCUS
Absolutely, sir! Right here! *(He pats a bulging briefcase he carries)* Locked, loaded, and ready to launch! I even added a few extra copies, just in case of… *spillage*.

*He gestures vaguely towards a table piled high with documents: several identical copies of REGINALD’S "Presidential Vision" speech on thick parchment, VAL’S meticulously organized exposé notes on a clipboard hidden beneath a napkin, CHESTER’S elaborately forged "Count" credentials, and BEATRICE’S colour-coded Gala Event Plans, complete with seating charts and vendor contracts.*

CLAUDIA
*(To Chester, loudly)*
Count, darling, do tell us about your homeland’s legendary cheese-rolling festival again! Petunia adores a good artisanal anecdote. Don’t you, my little brie-biter?

*CLAUDIA bends down, and PETUNIA, seizing the opportunity, leaps out of the purse. She lands with a barely audible *thump* and immediately darts under a nearby table, a flash of white fur.*

CLAUDIA
*(Gasps dramatically)*
Petunia! My precious! She’s off! Someone catch her! She’s prone to… *grazing*!

MARCUS
*(Eyes widening)*
The dog! It’s a rogue canine! Don’t worry, Mrs. Uppington! I’m trained in… *animal husbandry mitigation*!

*MARCUS, with surprising agility for a clumsy man, dives under the table, yelling "WHOA DOGGY!" His movements are clumsy but fast. The guests near the table recoil, knocking over a tray of champagne glasses. *CRASH!* Champagne splashes across the tablecloth and several expensive shoes. The band momentarily stops, then resumes playing slightly faster.*

BEATRICE
*(Hands flying to her face)*
The champagne! The linen! My perfect symmetry! This is not five-star! This is… *three-star motel chaos*!

*Petunia, startled by the crash and Marcus’s sudden appearance, yelps and shoots out from under the table, running straight towards the document table.*

REGINALD
*(Eyes fixed on Marcus, who is now half under the table)*
Marcus! The briefcase! Protect the… the *contents*!

*Petunia leaps onto the document table, her tiny paws scattering papers like confetti. She grabs a corner of one of Reginald’s speeches, tearing a small piece, and shakes it playfully. MARCUS, emerging from under the table on all fours, scrambles towards her.*

MARCUS
Gotcha! Dirty dog! Bad dog! *(He lunges, overshooting Petunia)*

*MARCUS collides with the table, sending the remaining stacks of documents – Reginald’s speeches, Val’s exposé notes, Chester’s credentials, Beatrice’s plans – flying into the air. They descend like a snowstorm of ambition, pretense, and financial data.*

GUESTS
*(Gasping, recoiling, some laughing politely)*
Oh! My word!

CLAUDIA
*(Shrieking)*
Petunia! You’ll ruin my reputation! Not to mention… *those papers*!

*Total pandemonium. Everyone scrambles. Reginald dashes forward, silk scarf flying, revealing his glistening scalp. Chester abandons his audience, diving for papers. Val leaps into action to retrieve her notes. Penelope, though amused, moves to help. Freddy steps forward, a quiet observer.*

REGINALD
*(On his knees, frantically gathering papers, inadvertently swapping the scarf for one of Reginald’s speeches)*
My vision! My legacy! My… my… *follicular integrity*!

*He has inadvertently picked up CHESTER’S forged documents. He tries to quickly read them, squinting.*

REGINALD
"…Count von Geldberg, Knight of the Order of the Gilded Truffle, Hereditary Pig-Herder of the Carpathian Foothills…" What in the blazes is this?! This isn't *my* economic policy!

CHESTER
*(Also on his knees, sweeping up VAL’S exposé notes, thinking they’re blank pages)*
My *credentials*! My birthright! *(He glances at Val’s cramped handwriting)* "…the cynical manipulation of social hierarchies, the desperate pretense of the nouveau riche…" What is this gibberish? A grocery list? A poetic lament?

VAL
*(Having retrieved Reginald’s speech, and finding it too voluminous to hide immediately)*
My notes! My hard work! *(She sees Reginald’s bold pronouncements)* "…and I, Reginald Worthington the Third, shall lead you into an era of unprecedented… *synergistic effulgence*!" Oh, good heavens, not *that* again.

MARCUS
*(Now on his hands and knees, giggling, as Petunia playfully tugs at a page from Beatrice’s gala plans)*
Gotcha, you little rascal! And look! Confetti! For the… *post-vote celebrations*!

*He triumphantly holds up a large sheet of BEATRICE’S meticulous budget, complete with colour-coded expenditure columns, mistaking it for celebratory paper.*

CLAUDIA
*(Seeing Petunia with the budget page)*
Petunia! Give that back! That's Beatrice’s… oh, never mind! *(She lunges, but misses)*

BEATRICE
*(Stands amidst the chaos, utterly defeated, clipboard held limply)*
My budgets… my catering allocations… my *artisanal* truffle parmesan straws budget! Ruined! All of it! *(A tear escapes and rolls down her cheek)* I just wanted one nice event… just one!

PENELOPE
*(Calmly, picking up a stray financial ledger from the club, clearly marked "Grandview Heights Social Club: Members’ Unpaid Dues & Questionable Investments")*
Well, this looks… *interesting*. Quite the artisanal accounting.

FREDDY
*(Stepping forward, reaching down to help a flustered waiter who slipped on a wet spot)*
Steady there. Looks like the financial foundations are as precarious as the social ones tonight.

*Reginald, still clutching Chester’s fake credentials, looks bewildered. Chester, holding Val’s exposé notes, tries to compose himself, his accent now a bewildering blend of Scottish and something vaguely Middle-Eastern. Val tries to discreetly fold Reginald’s lengthy speech into her apron. Marcus is still trying to get Petunia to play fetch with the budget sheet. Claudia wails about her dog. Beatrice sobs softly.*

REGINALD
*(Holding up Chester’s forged "Knight of the Gilded Truffle" certificate)*
"…awarded for services to outstanding… *fungal cultivation*?" Good heavens, am I running for President or Head Gardener? This is not the *vision* I articulated!

CHESTER
*(Eyes darting, trying to make sense of Val’s notes)*
"…the emperor has no clothes, only a very convincing wig and a terrible tailor…" What kind of cryptic prophecy is this? Is this from the ancient Geldbergian sagas?

VAL
*(Muttering to herself, attempting to discreetly read Reginald’s speech)*
"…and our members, the very vanguard of society, shall be treated to a veritable cornucopia of… *executive-level amenities*." Oh, the irony.

MARCUS
*(To Petunia, completely oblivious)*
Fetch! Good girl! You found the secret dessert menu! *(He triumphantly holds up Beatrice’s detailed schedule for the evening’s voting procedure)*

*Petunia barks excitedly, then, spotting a dropped canapé, darts under another table, dragging a corner of Beatrice’s schedule with her.*

BEATRICE
*(Her voice a thin, reedy whisper)*
The voting sequence… the ballot count… oh, the humanity…

*The band, sensing the rising chaos, transitions into a frantic polka, making the scene even more absurd. Guests are now openly staring, some chuckling, others aghast. Reginald clutches Chester’s documents, completely exposed and bald. Val secretly fumbles with Reginald’s speech. Chester attempts to look intellectual while holding Val’s scathing notes. Marcus chases the dog with Beatrice’s ballot schedule. Claudia is still trying to grab her dog. Penelope shakes her head, amused, with the financial ledger in hand. Freddy simply sips his champagne, a knowing smile playing on his lips. The Grand Ballroom, once a bastion of decorum, has devolved into a swirling vortex of misplaced papers, yapping dogs, and shattered dignity. The stage lights dim slightly, emphasizing the pandemonium.*
