[SCENE START]

**ACT 1, SCENE 5**

**SETTING:** The **COSTUME STORAGE ROOM** of the Grandview Heights Social Club.

*   The room is a glorious disaster of fabric, tinsel, and forgotten dreams. Racks overflow with moth-eaten ballgowns, faded velvet jackets, oversized animal mascots, and shelves groan under the weight of peculiar hats, wigs (some bald), fake mustaches, monocles, and plastic weaponry. Boxes labelled "Victorian Era Whimsy," "Roaring Twenties Folly," and "Generic European Monarch" are stacked precariously. A single, dusty window looks out onto a brick wall.*

*   At center, amidst a cascade of sequined capes and a pile of discarded clown shoes, stands CHESTER BLUFF. He is alone, reveling in his private performance. He holds a small hand mirror, practicing various poses and facial expressions. He has a variety of fake mustaches laid out on a nearby box like an artist's palette, trying each one on, discarding it, trying another.*

CHESTER
(In a thick, gravelly Russian accent, twirling an enormous, curly mustache)
"Count Vladimir von Moneystein, at your service, my dear. I have come from the frosty plains of… Transnistria! Yes, Transnistria. Full of blini and… existential dread."
(He pulls it off, wrinkles his nose. Tries a thin, pencil-line mustache, switches to an exaggerated French accent)
"Non, non, non! Le Comte Henri Dubois-Moneystein. From ze Loire Valley, where ze wine flows like… like ze, ah, ze, *ze champagne*! Oui! I am a connoisseur of fine… *eau de vie* and scandalous whispers."
(He rips it off, practically flings it. Picks up a monocle and a thick handlebar mustache, puts them on. A crisp, almost German, yet slightly Austrian, accent emerges. He strikes a regal pose.)
"Ah, Count Leopold von Geldberg! A name that resonates with old-world charm and new-world capital! My family, you see, has roots deep in the… *financial bedrock* of the continent. We own… *mines*! Many mines. And… *unicorns*."
(He beams, admiring his reflection. He adjusts the monocle, then the handlebar mustache, which is already slightly askew.)
"Yes, this has gravitas. Gravitas with a hint of… accessible hauteur. Reginald will eat it up like a plate of… *goulash* from a gilded trough."

*   The door to the costume room creaks open just as Chester is puffing out his chest. VAL SHARP, dressed in her caterer's apron, slips silently into the room. She carries a tray of empty champagne flutes, but her eyes are scanning, her ears perked. She sees Chester, unaware she's there, still preening.*

VAL
(Quietly, to herself, taking out her tiny notepad and jotting)
"Ah, the true monarch of this kingdom of make-believe."

CHESTER
(Still admiring himself, oblivious)
"They will flock to me! The scent of 'old money' mixed with a dash of 'exotic mystery' is simply… irresistible to these social vultures. And Reginald, bless his toupeed ambition, believes every word! Soon, my pockets will be as deep as my… *fictional ancestry*."
(He gives a satisfied chuckle.)

VAL
(Steps forward, clearing her throat. Her voice is calm, but sharp.)
"And what fictional ancestry would that be, Count Leopold von Geldberg? Or should I say, Chester Bluff?"

*   Chester nearly jumps out of his skin. He spins around, monocle falling, mustache half-peeling off his face. He quickly shoves the mustache in his pocket, then tries to retrieve the monocle with feigned casualness.*

CHESTER
(A sudden, very British, clipped accent)
"I say, what in blazes? One almost had a spot of bother, wouldn't you agree? Bit of a… startle. You're... the catering staff, aren't you? Excellent canapés, by the by."

VAL
(Raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. She pockets her notepad.)
"The accent shifts faster than Reginald's toupee. And I've seen your game, Mr. Bluff. The fake credentials, the absurd stories, the way you charm money out of these desperate socialites. It's quite a performance."

CHESTER
(He tries to regain composure, puffing out his chest. The British accent holds, but a hint of something Eastern European creeps in.)
"Performance? My dear girl, you misunderstand. This isn't a performance. This is… *infiltration*. A delicate dance of deception, yes, but for the greater good!"

VAL
"Oh? And what greater good would that be? Lining your own pockets, I presume?"

CHESTER
(Leans in conspiratorially, lowering his voice. The accent is now a strange Anglo-European hybrid.)
"Not entirely! You see, I am not merely Chester Bluff, charlatan extraordinaire, at your service. I am… (he glances around dramatically) …an undercover operative. From a highly classified agency. The… *Bureau of Pecuniary Ethics and International Shenanigans*."

VAL
(Crosses her arms, completely unconvinced.)
"The B.P.E.I.S.? You expect me to believe that?"

CHESTER
"It's a very new agency! Top secret! You wouldn't have heard of it. My mission, you see, is to expose the very fraud and pretension that permeates these… gilded halls! I am here to… *sniff out the truth*!"
(He mimes sniffing the air like a bloodhound, nearly toppling over a stack of feathered hats.)

VAL
(A dry laugh escapes her.)
"So you're exposing fraud by committing fraud? That's quite the meta-approach. And conveniently, you're the only 'undercover agent' who gets to keep all the ill-gotten gains?"

CHESTER
"No, no, no! The funds are merely… *operational expenses*. To blend in! To establish credibility! One must speak their language, my dear. The language of… *absurd wealth* and *unearned status*."
(He attempts to adjust his non-existent monocle again.)

VAL
"You almost had me with the name change. But 'Bureau of Pecuniary Ethics and International Shenanigans' is a bit much, even for this place. I've got enough on you to write an exposé that'll make Reginald's toupee look like solid gold."

CHESTER
(His eyes widen slightly. He tries another tactic, leaning closer, a touch of desperation in his voice, now vaguely Slavic.)
"Wait, wait! Before you ruin my… *very important mission*, perhaps we could… *collaborate*? You, the intrepid journalist. Me, the… (he struggles for a word) …the *artisan of truth*! Think of the headlines! 'Count Reveals All!'"

VAL
"And what exactly would you reveal? How many fake identities you've cycled through this week?"

*   Suddenly, there's a loud THUMP against the door, followed by a muffled string of curses.*

MARCUS (O.S.)
"Confound it, this portal is proving resistant to optimal engagement! My hands are full of… synergistic enhancers!"

CHESTER
(Panicked, grabbing Val's arm)
"Someone's coming! And they cannot know of our… *strategic alignment*!"

VAL
"Strategic alignment? You mean your pathetic attempt to lie your way out of trouble?"

*   The door HANDLE rattles violently. Chester shoves Val behind a rack of clown costumes. He tries to quickly put on a different mustache, but it's sticky on one side and flaps comically.*

CHESTER
"Quick! Appear… *incognito*!"

*   The door bursts open with a crash, revealing MARCUS FUMBLE. He's struggling with an armload of utterly random items: a giant inflatable flamingo, a box of mismatched party poppers, and a dozen sequined fedoras. He stumbles into the room, and the door slams shut behind him with a definitive CLANG, followed by the sound of the automatic lock engaging.*

MARCUS
"Blast! It appears I've achieved unanticipated door-closure synergy! The architectural ingress mechanism has engaged its autonomous security protocol!"
(He struggles, dropping the flamingo, which bobs comically.)
"These 'campaign materials' are proving… logistically challenging. Reginald explicitly requested 'elements to elevate the ambiance and inspire aspirational engagement.' He also said to find 'something with flair.' Do we have flair?"
(He finally notices Chester, who is trying to discreetly remove the half-stuck mustache.)
"Ah, Count von Moneystein! And… (he peers behind Chester) …Ms. Sharp! What an unexpected co-location!"

*   Val emerges from behind the costumes, trying to look casual. She has champagne flutes on her tray. Chester, thinking quickly, throws an arm around Val's shoulders, pulling her close. He beams at Marcus, forcing a wide, unconvincing smile. The floppy mustache makes him look even more absurd.*

CHESTER
(A ridiculously over-the-top, syrupy Italian accent now, full of false bonhomie)
"Ah, Marcus, my dear boy! What a… *surprise*! You have caught us in a moment of… *intimate collaboration*!"

VAL
(Stiffening under Chester's arm, trying to maintain her composure.)
"Yes. Very… intimate."

MARCUS
(Blinking, oblivious.)
"Intimate collaboration? Is that a new corporate initiative? Is it part of the 'aspirational engagement' strategy?"

CHESTER
(Squeezing Val's shoulder, practically winking at Marcus.)
"Precisely, my friend! We were just… *discussing the future*! The future of… *our partnership*!"

VAL
(Muttering, through gritted teeth.)
"Partnership, right."

MARCUS
"Partnership? Excellent! Reginald will be thrilled! More synergy! What kind of partnership? A joint venture? A strategic alliance in the catering sector?"

CHESTER
(Pulling Val even closer, a desperate twinkle in his eye.)
"No, no, no, Marcus! Far more… *personal*! We were just sealing our… *eternal bond*! Our… *sacred union*!"

VAL
(Her eyes wide, a flicker of panic. She attempts to discreetly kick Chester in the shin.)
"Our… *eternal bond*?"

CHESTER
(Wincing slightly from the kick, but maintaining the smile.)
"Oui! Si! Ja! We are… *engaged*! To be married! A whirlwind romance, you understand! The passion, it simply… *erupted*!"

*   Val stares at Chester, mouth agape. She can't believe he just said that. She looks at Marcus, who is beaming, completely sold.*

MARCUS
(Gasps, dropping the box of party poppers, which go off with tiny, pathetic pops.)
"Engaged? Oh, my word! Count von Moneystein and Ms. Sharp! This is truly an unexpected development! A romantic merger of titanic proportions! I must inform Reginald immediately! He will be ecstatic!"

VAL
(Whispering frantically to Chester.)
"You absolute lunatic! What have you done?!"

CHESTER
(Whispering back, still smiling at Marcus.)
"Improvise, my dear! Improvise! It was the only way! Now, play along!"
(He gives Val's shoulder a squeeze, then leans in as if to kiss her, making a loud SMACKing sound near her ear. Val recoils.)

MARCUS
(Clapping his hands with glee.)
"Oh, the romance! The sheer, unadulterated romance! This is even better than 'flair'! This is… 'gravitas with emotional resonance'!"
(He fumbles with the door handle, trying to open it.)
"I must egress and disseminate this joyous intelligence! Reginald will want to propose a toast! Perhaps a 'champagne shower of corporate blessings'!"

VAL
(Trying to pull away from Chester, mortified.)
"Marcus, wait! It's not exactly—"

CHESTER
(Cutting her off smoothly, still in the Italian accent.)
"She is overcome with emotion, Marcus! The surprise! The… *unveiling of our love*! She is usually so reserved, my little artichoke heart."

MARCUS
"An artichoke heart! How poetic! What a tender metaphor! I'll make sure to include that in the internal memo!"

*   Marcus finally manages to jiggle the door handle just right. With a triumphant shout of "Leverage applied! Portal operational!", he yanks it open. Before Val or Chester can protest further, he turns back to them, eyes shining.*

MARCUS
"Congratulations, you two! I'm so profoundly happy for your newfound… *conjugal synergy*! I'll go inform the entire club! This is groundbreaking news!"

*   Marcus exits the costume room with the enthusiasm of a puppy, the door swinging shut behind him.*

CHESTER
(Lets go of Val, wiping his brow dramatically. He picks up the inflatable flamingo, fanning himself.)
"Phew! That was a close shave! My quick thinking, it saved us!"

VAL
(Staring at him, absolutely livid, her voice dangerously quiet.)
"Saved us? Chester, you just got me 'engaged' to a con artist in a floppy mustache! My journalistic integrity is about to be annulled before my first exposé even runs!"

CHESTER
(Pats her arm patronizingly.)
"Nonsense! Think of it as… deeper cover! You're now intimately involved in the very absurdity you seek to expose! It’s brilliant! It's… *method acting for undercover journalism*!"

VAL
(Pulls out her notepad, furiously scribbling.)
" 'Engaged to the fake Count. Undercover FBI story highly suspect. Current cover: 'artichoke heart'.' This is going to be quite the article. Or quite the restraining order."

CHESTER
(Beaming, oblivious to her fury, adjusting the half-stuck mustache once more.)
"See? Already you are inspired! Now, my dear fiancée, perhaps we should discuss our… *honeymoon destination*? I've always fancied a private yacht in… Transnistria!"

*   Val glares at him, then at the ridiculous flamingo, then back at Chester, who is now trying on a sequined fedora. The chaotic sound of Marcus's excited shouts can be heard from down the hall, announcing the "engagement" to anyone who will listen. Val throws her hands up in exasperation, a picture of absolute, mortified defeat.*
