## ACT 2, SCENE 5

**SETTING**: The Grand Ballroom, now meticulously reset for the Presidential Vote, but with a palpable undercurrent of nervous energy. A large, ornate ballot box stands prominently on a pedestal center stage. CLUB MEMBERS are scattered, muttering amongst themselves, still reeling from the previous speeches. Reginald’s toupee is still askew, practically glued on backward, giving him a perpetually surprised expression. Claudia, however, basks in a post-performance glow, as if she'd masterminded the entire "deconstructionist art." Beatrice stands beside the ballot box, looking utterly shell-shocked, clutching her clipboard like a lifeline. Val is subtly scribbling notes on her tiny pad, occasionally glancing up with a mischievous glint. Marcus hovers, beaming with self-satisfaction. Chester slumps in a chair at the back, trying to appear inconspicuous. Penelope stands near the entrance, observing the absurdity with a dry, critical eye. Freddy, still in his makeshift server's vest, quietly places a tray of "I Voted!" stickers near the ballot box.

[SCENE OPENS]

**BEATRICE**
[Voice shaky, almost a whisper, she clears her throat several times. The microphone screeches loudly, making her jump. She taps it gingerly.]
Ahem. Good evening, esteemed members. If indeed it is still… good. Thank you for your… continued… presence. We now move to the pinnacle… of our annual gala. The vote. For President of the Grandview Heights Social Club.

**CLAUDIA**
[Sweeping forward, patting Beatrice's arm condescendingly]
Yes, yes, Beatrice, darling, let's not dwell. The performance art was *riveting*, truly. But now, for the actual *performance* of democracy. I, for one, feel utterly… *validated*.

**REGINALD**
[Adjusts his backward toupee, puffing out his chest, completely missing the irony]
Indeed. A triumph of transparency! My speech, a masterclass in… profound self-effacement! To lay bare the very soul of ambition! A bold move, if I do say so myself.

**MARCUS**
[Nodding vigorously, beaming]
Precisely, sir! The fragility of outward presentation! A groundbreaking exploration of the post-modern corporate psyche! The reviews are already… *imminent*!

**CHESTER**
[Muttering to himself, burying his face in his hands]
Imminent collapse, more like. My glorious Count von Moneystein, reduced to… a cautionary tale. *Mon Dieu*.

**BEATRICE**
[Trying to regain control, waving her clipboard weakly]
Members will now approach the ballot box. One vote per member. Please present your membership cards to… [She squints at her clipboard] …to… oh dear. Where is the verification officer?

**FREDDY**
[Stepping forward, holding a stack of neatly printed ballots]
I can help with that, Beatrice. I've prepared the official voting slips. And I have a ledger here for verification.

**CLAUDIA**
[Sniffs disdainfully]
Honestly, the staff in this club. Always so… *eager*. Fetch me a pen, *Freddy*, and perhaps a glass of something robust. This voting business is terribly *draining*.

**FREDDY**
[Smiling faintly, handing her a pen]
Of course, madam. [He gestures to the ballot box] Just ensure your vote is duly cast.

**PENELOPE**
[Stepping forward, finally unable to contain herself. She walks directly up to Reginald.]
Father. Just a moment. Before you… continue this farce.

**REGINALD**
[Turns, startled, nearly knocking his toupee off. He quickly slaps it back on, still backward.]
Penelope! My dear girl! What a… *precipitous* appearance! Are you here to… *commemorate* my brave foray into performance art?

**PENELOPE**
[Eyes rolling heavenward]
No, Father. I'm here because this has gone on long enough. Club members, if I may interrupt this… *process*. Reginald Worthington III has been attempting to portray himself as a singular, self-made man, a titan of industry and society.

**CLAUDIA**
[Haughtily]
Well, he *is* rather single-minded in his pursuit of… [She trails off, realizing Penelope is serious.] What is your point, young woman?

**PENELOPE**
My point, Madame Uppington, is that Reginald Worthington III has a dirty little secret. One he’s kept hidden to bolster his image as a solitary, unattached power broker. He has a daughter. Me. And he's consistently pretended I don't exist in these hallowed halls, purely for optics.

[A collective gasp ripples through the CLUB MEMBERS. Reginald sputters, his face turning a shade of puce.]

**REGINALD**
[Waving his hands frantically]
Nonsense! Poppycock! This is… a misunderstanding! A… a strategic familial oversight! A tribute to… my commitment to the club, to prevent any accusations of… nepotistic bias!

**PENELOPE**
[Dryly]
Or perhaps, Father, to avoid having to admit you have a daughter who finds your social climbing utterly insufferable.

**VAL**
[Whispering to herself, scribbling furiously]
"Reginald's paternal pretension exposed. Daughter reveals true familial fraud."

**CLAUDIA**
[Snapping her fingers, a predatory gleam in her eye]
Aha! A chink in the Worthington armor! Family scandals are simply *declassé*! Clearly, not fit for a club President!

**MARCUS**
[Confused, looking between Reginald and Penelope]
So… is this also part of the performance art, sir? A deconstruction of the patriarchal lineage within corporate structures? Very bold!

**REGINALD**
[Eyes bugging out, pushing Marcus away]
No, Marcus! Not performance art! This is… [He searches for a word] … personal! A personal… *interlude*!

[Just then, a small, yapping sound emanates from beneath the ballot box. CLAUDIA’S DOG, FIFI, suddenly wriggles out, shaking something in her mouth. She trots excitedly towards the center of the room, proudly depositing her 'treasure' on the polished floor.]

**CLAUDIA**
[Gasps, hands flying to her mouth]
Fifi! What have you got, you naughty little fluff-ball?!

[FIFI has dropped a rather extravagant, curled handlebar mustache, clearly fake. It lies innocently beside the ballot box.]

**CLUB MEMBER 1**
[Squinting]
Is that… a mustache?

**CLUB MEMBER 2**
[Picking it up gingerly with two fingers]
It looks… suspiciously familiar. Rather gaudy, wouldn't you say?

**VAL**
[Eyes widening, she looks at Chester, who has visibly shrunk in his chair. She scribbles faster.]
"Canine accomplice unearths Count's true identity: mustache as evidence!"

**CHESTER**
[Muttering under his breath, trying to meld with the wallpaper]
The dog. Of course, the dog. A creature of discerning taste, for tragedy.

**CLAUDIA**
[Stares at the mustache, then at Chester, then back at the mustache. A slow, dawning horror spreads across her face.]
Wait a minute… that… that looks exactly like the one the Count was wearing earlier! The one from his… "ancestral portrait"!

**REGINALD**
[Picking up the mustache, turning it over in his hand with distaste]
Indeed. A rather… *pedestrian* piece of facial adornment, for a man of such… *Carpathian* stature.

**CHESTER**
[Jumping up, trying to snatch the mustache back. He adopts a ridiculously exaggerated French accent.]
Ah! *Mon dieu*! My… my ancestral good luck charm! It must have… fallen! From my… pocket! A very, how you say, *personnel* item! Give it!

**PENELOPE**
[Observing Chester’s panic, raises an eyebrow]
"Ancestral good luck charm" that perfectly matches the one on the "authentically forged diplomatic papers" you spoke of, Claudia?

**CLAUDIA**
[Her eyes narrow, slowly connecting the dots. She slowly turns to Chester, her voice dripping with venom.]
"Count von Moneystein." "Ancient Carpathian horse breeders." "Private diamond mine in the Krapatoff Mountains." [She advances on Chester, Fifi yapping excitedly at her heels.] This… this was all… a fabrication?! My 'performance art' speech… was based on… a *lie*?!

**CHESTER**
[Backing away, tripping over a chair. His accents start to cycle wildly.]
A lie? No, no! A… a *theatrical embellishment*! A… a narrative exploration of… [He switches to a thick German accent] …of zee human condition! Ja!

**VAL**
[Stands up, holding her notepad aloft, abandoning all pretense of subtlety.]
He's a con artist! He's been posing as a wealthy count to swindle the club! I've been documenting his entire scheme!

[CLUB MEMBERS gasp again, louder this time. Some point at Chester, others at Val.]

**BEATRICE**
[Clutches her chest, her eyes wide]
Oh dear. Oh *dear*! Swindle?! The club? This is… this is beyond the purview of my events budget!

**MARCUS**
[Stepping forward, completely missing the point, still trying to "spin" things]
Aha! So the "Count" was merely an avatar of meta-commentary! His fraudulent persona, a critique of inherited wealth! Brilliant! Mr. Bluff, your dedication to performance art is unparalleled!

**CHESTER**
[To Marcus, exasperated, now with a vague Russian accent]
No, you imbecile! I vas trying to fleece them! Fleece! Like a sheep!

**MARCUS**
[Beaming]
Aha! The pastoral metaphor! Subtly juxtaposing the urban elite with the rustic innocence of the herd! Profound!

**FREDDY**
[Stepping forward, seeing the chaos. He has a calm, almost amused smile. He gently takes Beatrice's clipboard from her shaking hands and places it on the ballot box. He then reaches into his vest pocket and pulls out a sleek, modern smartphone, tapping it once.]
Excuse me, everyone. I think we've had enough "performance art" for one evening. And enough fraud.

**CLUB MEMBER 3**
[Indignant]
See here, waiter! You have no business interfering!

**FREDDY**
[Raises an eyebrow, a flicker of genuine authority in his voice for the first time.]
Actually, I do. You see, I am not, in fact, "Freddy the waiter." I am Frederick Montague, CEO of Global Synergy Holdings. And I've been rather enjoying observing the peculiar antics of this esteemed institution for the past few months.

[Silence. A stunned, absolute silence falls over the ballroom. Even Fifi stops yapping. Reginald's toupee seems to deflate slightly.]

**CLAUDIA**
[Her jaw drops, sputtering]
Freddy… Montague? *The* Frederick Montague? But… but you were… fetching me pens!

**FREDDY**
[Shrugs, a twinkle in his eye]
Someone had to. It seemed to be the most productive activity happening in the room.

**REGINALD**
[Staggering backward, pointing a shaky finger at Freddy]
You… you're… *actually* wealthy?! But… but you dress like… like a casual Friday! No bespoke suits! No ostentatious accessories!

**FREDDY**
[Smiling]
I prefer comfort. And authenticity. Which, it seems, is in rather short supply here.

**VAL**
[Seizing the moment, steps forward, holding up her notepad and finally, explicitly, her press badge which she pulls from her apron. She points at Reginald, then Claudia, then Chester.]
And *I* am Valentina Sharp, investigative journalist for *The Metropolitan Insider*! I've been undercover here to expose the very pretension, fraud, and absurdity you've all so generously provided! I have enough material for a front-page exposé!

[A cacophony erupts. CLUB MEMBERS burst into confused murmurs, some pointing, some gasping, some looking utterly betrayed. Reginald clutches his head. Claudia shrieks.]

**CLAUDIA**
A journalist?! Undercover?! This is… this is an outrage! My reputation! My Fifi!

**REGINALD**
[Waving his backward toupee around as he tries to process it all.]
A journalist! A fraud! My daughter! A *real* wealthy person acting as a… a common manservant! This is… a catastrophe of epic proportions! My presidency! My *dignity*!

**MARCUS**
[Suddenly points excitedly at Val’s badge.]
Aha! Another layer! So, she's actually performing the *role* of a journalist, documenting the *performance* of society! The meta-narrative deepens! It’s brilliant! It’s…

[Just then, FIFI, startled by the sheer volume of chaotic noise, scurries under the ballot box. Her tiny paw, perhaps seeking refuge, accidentally brushes against a red, unmarked button on the side of the pedestal.]

[A deafening, piercing **FIRE ALARM** blares through the ballroom. Red strobe lights flash wildly. A disembodied, booming voice announces over the loudspeakers: "ATTENTION. ATTENTION. IMMEDIATE EVACUATION. PLEASE PROCEED TO THE NEAREST EXIT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION."]

[Utter pandemonium. CLUB MEMBERS shriek and scramble. Everyone rushes for the exits. Marcus, trying to be helpful, pushes a group of people in the wrong direction. Reginald, startled, flings his backward toupee into the air. It lands squarely on Claudia’s head, covering her eyes. She stumbles blindly, Fifi yapping frantically from within her purse.]

**CLAUDIA**
[Yelling, Reginald's toupee on her head]
My eyes! I can't see! Someone save Fifi! And my pearls!

**REGINALD**
[Hands scrambling for his bald head, then realizing his toupee is gone.]
My hair! Where is my glorious mane?! My dignity is in tatters!

**CHESTER**
[Seeing an opportunity, tries to slip out quietly, but is immediately caught in the crush.]
Ach! Foiled by a dog and a fire alarm! Is there no justice in zis ridiculous vorld?!

**PENELOPE**
[Grabs Reginald by the arm, dragging him towards an exit.]
Come on, Father! Your dignity left with your toupee!

**FREDDY**
[Calmly directs people, a wry smile on his face, as if this is precisely what he expected.]
This way, everyone. No need to panic. Unless you enjoy it.

**BEATRICE**
[Collapses dramatically to the floor, amidst the chaos, her clipboard pages scattering like confetti.]
My gala! My beautiful, ruined gala! I just wanted one night! One!

**VAL**
[Still scribbling, even as she's pushed towards the exit, her eyes wide with a journalist's delight.]
"Fire alarm triggered by canine accomplice amidst cascading revelations! Ultimate farcical climax!"

**MARCUS**
[Tripping over a discarded champagne bucket, lands near Beatrice. He sees her scattered papers.]
Don't worry, Beatrice! This is simply the climactic act of the performance! The ultimate deconstruction of structured events! Everyone, outside! To the next "installation"!

[The stage empties in a rush of screams, stumbles, and flailing limbs. Reginald, bald, Claudia, blinded by a toupee, Chester, trapped, Val, scribbling, Penelope, exasperated, Freddy, amused, Beatrice, prone, and Marcus, still beaming, are swept away with the frantic crowd.]

[SOUND of the fire alarm continues to blare as the stage is left utterly deserted, save for a few scattered ballots, a single high heel, and the empty ballot box.]

[FADE TO BLACK.]
