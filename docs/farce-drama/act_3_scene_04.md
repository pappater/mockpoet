**ACT 3, SCENE 4**

**SETTING:** The Grand Ballroom, now a dishevelled aftermath of the gala, transitioning into an impromptu, slightly melancholic celebration. Chairs are askew, a few stray streamers cling to a chandelier, and a makeshift table holds a punch bowl and some half-eaten canapés. The atmosphere is less formal, more a collective exhale of bewildered acceptance. The relic voting machine from the previous scene still sits centre stage, eerily silent, a forgotten monument to absurdity.

**(AT RISE: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY stands by the punch bowl, looking utterly shell-shocked. She wears her blazer inside out, a nametag reading "PRESIDENT-ELECT?" askew. MARCUS FUMBLE hovers near her, attempting to fan her with a soggy canapé tray. REGINALD WORTHINGTON III, still toupee-less, stands with a surprisingly straight posture, a strange mix of defeat and liberation on his face. PENELOPE PRIM, a small smile playing on her lips, stands beside him, occasionally patting his arm. CLAUDIA UPPINGTON sits stiffly on an overturned champagne bucket, clutching FIFI, who is wearing a tiny, slightly singed party hat. FREDDY MONTAGUE leans against a pillar, a knowing smile on his face, looking perfectly at ease. VAL SHARP, having discreetly put away her notepad, observes from a corner, a glimmer of amusement in her eyes.)**

**MARCUS**
**(Fanning Beatrice vigorously, sending crumbs flying)**
There, there, President Flutterby! A moment of constitutional clarity is all that's required. Perhaps a deep breath? Or, as our corporate synergy model dictates, a robust pivot to... oxygenation!

**BEATRICE**
**(Dazed, eyes wide)**
Oxygenation. Right. My first executive order. More air. And less... less everything. I just wanted one event without a disaster. One. And now... I'm...

**(She trails off, gesturing vaguely at herself. Marcus nods sagely.)**

**REGINALD**
**(To Penelope, a hand instinctively reaching for his bald head before dropping it)**
It’s… rather liberating, isn’t it, darling? To have one’s ambitions utterly, irrevocably… *crushed*. Like a soufflé under a runaway rhino. No more pretense. No more... hair-raising anxiety.

**PENELOPE**
**(Smiling warmly)**
It suits you, Dad. The honesty. Though, I think "runaway rhino" might be an understatement for the last forty-eight hours.

**CLAUDIA**
**(Sniffing disdainfully, adjusting Fifi's hat)**
Honesty? This isn't honesty, Reginald, it's capitulation! To *her*!
**(She gestures vaguely at Beatrice with Fifi’s paw.)**
A woman who can barely coordinate a napkin ring, let alone a presidency! My Fifi has more decorum. Don't you, my little empress of etiquette?
**(Fifi lets out a tiny, high-pitched yelp.)**

**BEATRICE**
**(Eyes still unfocused, mumbling)**
Napkin rings. Add to list. New stationery, change letterhead. "Grandview Heights Social Club, Office of the President, Beatrice Flutterby, Esq. (accidental)."

**FREDDY**
**(Pushing himself off the pillar, walking towards the group with a casual grace)**
Beatrice, I think you'll find the club has always run on a certain... chaotic efficiency. You're simply formalising it. Think of yourself as the CEO of glorious pandemonium.

**CLAUDIA**
**(Eyes narrowing at Freddy)**
You! The 'waiter' who happens to own the voting machine conglomerate! Still lurking, I see. What, did you stay for the free punch? Or are you expecting a tip for fixing your prehistoric contraption?

**FREDDY**
**(Chuckles softly)**
Oh, I just like to see my products in action. And yes, the punch *is* surprisingly robust. A subtle raspberry note. Quite the unexpected ascent from concentrate, wouldn't you say?

**VAL**
**(Approaching, a genuine smile on her face)**
I think the word you're looking for, Freddy, is 'absurd'. It's been quite the masterclass. And I believe, President Flutterby, you're the most authentic thing this club has seen in decades.

**BEATRICE**
**(Startled by the title, she nearly drops her clipboard, which she's somehow acquired)**
Authentic? Oh dear. Does that mean I don't get the secret handshake? Or the key to the executive champagne cellar? I just found a half-eaten jelly doughnut under the podium.

**(Suddenly, a series of muted thuds and a distinctive "Oof!" is heard from behind a large potted palm near a service door.)**

**MARCUS**
**(Jumping, scattering more crumbs)**
Aha! The clandestine pastry procurement unit! I knew it! They're still attempting a midnight snack run!

**(The potted palm begins to wobble violently. A foot in a very shiny, very fake patent leather shoe protrudes from beneath it, followed by a hand attempting to brush dirt from an impossibly clean velvet lapel.)**

**CLAUDIA**
**(Gasps dramatically)**
Good heavens! It's that ruffian! The "Count"!

**(The potted palm is finally pushed aside with a theatrical flourish, revealing CHESTER BLUFF, looking remarkably unruffled, though a few leaves cling to his hair. He wears a freshly acquired, if slightly ill-fitting, waiter's jacket over his own attire, giving him a bizarre, layered look. He has a small tray with two glasses of punch in one hand, which he offers with a dazzling smile.)**

**CHESTER**
**(In a perfectly modulated, slightly exaggerated English accent)**
Ah, my dearest friends! Did you truly think a trifle like 'security' could detain one of my... particular talents? I merely needed to observe the 'after-party dynamics' for my next performance piece. And this punch, one must admit, is surprisingly... proletarian. But effective!

**REGINALD**
**(Stares, bewildered)**
You're... back. But the guards... the unpaid tabs...

**CHESTER**
**(Waving a dismissive hand)**
Mere bureaucratic trifles! I explained it was all part of an immersive, participatory art installation. A critique of late-stage capitalism through the medium of gratuitous indulgence and strategic insolvency. They found it terribly avant-garde. And quite possibly, they still think I'm the cultural attaché from some obscure principality.
**(He winks conspiratorially at Val.)**
Or perhaps they just appreciated the impromptu mime performance of "Man Trapped in a Bureaucratic Loop." Very moving, apparently.

**VAL**
**(Shaking her head, a genuine laugh escaping)**
I don't doubt it, Chester. You have a way.

**MARCUS**
**(Eyes widening, snapping his fingers)**
That's it! The meta-narrative! The entire evening was a performance piece! A grand, sprawling, improvised operetta of social critique! The voting machine, the dog, the accidental speeches... it was all part of the artistic vision! Reginald, you were a method actor! And Beatrice, you are the tragicomic protagonist!

**CLAUDIA**
**(Scoffs, clutching Fifi tighter)**
A method actor? He just forgot his lines, Marcus! And *I* am certainly not a background prop in some bohemian circus! I am a pillar of society!

**MARCUS**
**(Undeterred, now gesturing wildly)**
No, no, Claudia, you were the formidable antagonist! The embodiment of entrenched traditionalism, destined to be overthrown by the absurd tide of innovation! The punch bowl, a symbol of communal intoxication! The canapés, transient sustenance for the soul! It all makes sense now!

**PENELOPE**
**(To Reginald, stifling a giggle)**
He's got a point, Dad. You *were* quite the method actor.

**REGINALD**
**(Considering Marcus's words, a strange pride swelling in his chest)**
Performance art, you say? So my toupee... or lack thereof... was a statement? A bold embrace of aesthetic deconstruction?

**CHESTER**
**(Nodding sagely)**
Precisely, Reginald! A minimalist commentary on the fragility of constructed identities. Bravo, I say! Bravo!
**(He clinks the two punch glasses he's holding together, then takes a sip from one.)**

**BEATRICE**
**(Suddenly perking up slightly, clipboard in hand)**
So, as president, I’m the... artistic director? Of the chaos? Hmm. Maybe "chaos coordinator" sounds more official for the business cards. Note to self: research 'avant-garde club management'.

**FREDDY**
**(Raises an eyebrow at Chester's punch consumption)**
Well, I think Marcus might have inadvertently stumbled upon the most profound interpretation of the evening. We are all, in our own way, performing. Climbing towards something, often without knowing what it is, and frequently tripping over our own feet.

**CLAUDIA**
**(Still indignant)**
I am doing no such thing! I am simply *being* Claudia Uppington! A woman of impeccable taste and discerning social standing! Fifi, tell them!
**(Fifi lets out a small whimper, then yawns.)**

**FREDDY**
**(Raises his punch glass, looking around at the motley crew)**
To that, then. To the absurd ascent of humanity. We're all trying to climb toward something, usually while tripping over our own feet. May we at least enjoy the view, however ridiculous it may be.

**(He clinks his glass lightly with Chester's, then with Reginald's. Val raises an imaginary glass. Penelope raises her hand. Marcus clinks his canapé tray with Freddy's glass. Beatrice, still dazed, clinks her clipboard with the side of the punch bowl.)**

**ALL**
**(A mix of "Hear, hear," and "To that!")**

**(As they all take a sip of punch, FIFI, startled by the clinking, suddenly wriggles free from Claudia's grasp. She darts under the punch table, causing it to wobble violently. The punch bowl tilts precariously. Claudia shrieks.)**

**CLAUDIA**
FIFI! My angel!

**MARCUS**
**(Pointing)**
The catalyst! The chaotic element that binds the narrative!

**(The punch bowl finally topples, sending a cascade of sticky, red liquid and floating fruit onto the floor. Beatrice, with presidential instinct, dives forward to save her clipboard, landing in the splash. Reginald, in an act of paternal protection, shields Penelope, getting drenched. Chester, with cat-like reflexes, gracefully leaps over the liquid, landing on a chair with his punch glass still intact. Claudia screams as a splash hits her expensive shoes. Freddy, still calm, just steps back, a small smile on his face.)**

**BEATRICE**
**(Spluttering, covered in punch, but holding her clipboard aloft like a trophy)**
My notes! They're... sticky! This is going to make the transition difficult!

**REGINALD**
**(Shaking his head, punch dripping from his bald pate)**
Difficult? My dear Beatrice, this *is* the transition. And somehow... it feels right.

**PENELOPE**
**(Wiping punch from her face, laughing)**
Welcome to the club, Dad. Literally.

**CLAUDIA**
**(On the verge of tears, dabbing at her shoes with Fifi's party hat)**
This is an outrage! My shoes! And my dog is now officially a... a punch-soaked hooligan! This club is going to the dogs! Literally!

**(Fifi, having resurfaced, trots past Marcus, who is now trying to mop up the punch with his tie. She leaves a trail of sticky paw prints across the floor and then directly over the silent voting machine.)**

**MARCUS**
**(Looking at Fifi's paw prints on the machine, a revelation dawning)**
The true president! The chaotic heart of Grandview Heights! It was Fifi all along! The ultimate puppet master!

**(Marcus points dramatically at Fifi, who stops by the voting machine, sniffs it, then lifts her leg and pees on it. A small, sputtering sound comes from the machine, then it coughs, and a final, garbled voice echoes through the ballroom.)**

**VOTING MACHINE**
**(Staticky, dying out)**
VOTE... RECEIVED... FIFI... UPPINGTON... FOR... ETERNITY...

**(A collective gasp. Claudia faints, dropping Fifi. Fifi, now free, yaps happily. Reginald throws his head back and laughs, a booming, genuine laugh. Penelope smiles. Val grins. Freddy shakes his head, still smiling. Chester takes another sip of punch, surveying the scene with a triumphant smirk. Beatrice, dripping with punch, simply sighs, pulls out a pen, and begins to write on her sticky clipboard, presumably a new "to-do" list. The ballroom, sticky and dishevelled, is filled with laughter, chaos, and the bizarre acceptance of it all.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK. CURTAIN.)**
