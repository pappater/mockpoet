# ACT 1, SCENE 2

## THE CATERER AND THE CON ARTIST

**SETTING:** The bustling, industrial kitchen of the Grandview Heights Social Club. Stainless steel surfaces gleam under harsh fluorescent lights. Several massive ovens, a long prep counter laden with ingredients, and a dizzying array of pots, pans, and utensils dominate the space. Various catering staff, dressed in crisp white jackets and aprons, move with purposeful efficiency, though a palpable sense of pre-event tension hangs in the air. Service doors lead offstage to the main club areas. A swinging door leads to the scullery.

*(At the prep counter, VALENTINA "VAL" SHARP, dressed in a pristine caterer's apron, deftly garnishes a platter of miniature quiches. Her movements are sharp and precise. She occasionally glances around, observing, and then discreetly pulls a tiny notepad and pencil from a hidden pocket in her apron to scribble a quick note, before tucking it away again.)*

*(BEATRICE FLUTTERBY, clipboard clutched tightly, scurries across the stage, nearly colliding with a stack of empty champagne glasses.)*

**BEATRICE**
(Muttering to herself)
Thirty-seven quail eggs, four hundred vol-au-vents, and where is the organic elderflower foam? Oh, the foam! It must foam!

*(Beatrice spots VAL and rushes over, her anxiety palpable.)*

**BEATRICE**
Val, darling, have you seen Chef Dubois? He’s supposed to be supervising the… the artisanal microgreens. They need to be individually blessed, apparently.

**VAL**
(Calmly, without looking up from her quiches)
I believe he’s currently mediating a dispute between the sous chef and the pastry chef over the structural integrity of the spun sugar birdcages. Apparently, one prefers a more ‘avian baroque’ aesthetic, while the other is staunchly ‘neoclassical ornithological.’

**BEATRICE**
(Wringing her hands)
Oh, dear. More artistic temperament. Can’t they just… bake? Just for one night? The Grandview Heights Social Club Gala is not the place for revolutionary edible architecture! It’s for status, tradition, and moderately palatable canapés!

*(A service door SWINGS open with a flourish, and CHESTER BLUFF enters. He is impeccably dressed in a slightly-too-flashy suit, complete with a silk pocket square and a rather ornate, antique-looking signet ring. He carries a silver-topped cane, which he uses more for dramatic effect than support. He strikes a pose, surveying the kitchen with an air of theatrical disdain. He immediately switches to a heavy, vaguely Slavic accent.)*

**CHESTER**
(Loudly, projecting)
Ah, the engine room of indulgence! The veritable crucible of culinary caprice! I require… a refreshment! Something with… *spirit*.

*(Val discreetly scribbles on her notepad. Beatrice looks flustered.)*

**BEATRICE**
(Eyes wide)
Oh! Count von Moneystein! Your Excellency! I… I thought you were in the VIP lounge. This is… the staff area.

**CHESTER**
(Waving a dismissive hand, his accent suddenly a little more German)
Nonsense, Frau Flutterby! A true connoisseur of life’s finer offerings seeks the source! To understand the symphony, one must visit the percussion section! And my percussion… it craves champagne. The vintage kind. Not the… *cooking* kind.

**VAL**
(Placing a finished platter onto a trolley, a hint of steel in her voice)
We usually reserve the Bollinger for the guests, Count. Are you here to inspect the truffle supplies, perhaps? I hear they’re particularly… *earthy* this season.

**CHESTER**
(Turning to VAL, a charming but calculating smile spreading across his face. His accent now leans distinctly French)
Ah, a server with spirit! A rare vintage indeed! One whose discerning eye for… *earthiness* suggests a palate refined beyond mere servitude. You, my dear, understand the subtle complexities of… *acquisition*.

*(He leans in conspiratorially, lowering his voice slightly, as if sharing a profound secret. Val meets his gaze, unimpressed but intrigued, taking another quick, hidden note.)*

**CHESTER**
(More to himself, but loud enough for Val to hear)
This “Grandview Heights Social Club”… such… *potential*. So much… *untapped resource*. A veritable goldmine of… *opportunity*. And such delightful… *gullibility*.

*(He winks at Val, who rolls her eyes almost imperceptibly as she turns to fetch a glass. Beatrice, meanwhile, is trying to direct a junior chef who is struggling with a giant bag of flour.)*

**BEATRICE**
No, no, you must *sift* it, Nigel! Not… not wrestle with it! We’re making soufflés, not performing an interpretive dance of grain!

*(Suddenly, the service door BURSTS open again, and MARCUS FUMBLE stumbles in, arms laden with his overflowing briefcase, a large, pristine chef's hat perched precariously on his head, and a comically oversized, brand new apron tied around his waist. He nearly trips over a mop bucket, sending a small splash of murky water across the floor. He has the air of someone completely out of his depth but utterly convinced he's in control.)*

**MARCUS**
(Beaming, oblivious to the chaos he’s causing)
Aha! Campaign Central! Or as I like to call it, the Gastronomic Persuasion Hub! Reporting for duty, Chief Culinary Strategist!

*(Marcus accidentally backs into a trolley of finished desserts, sending a tremor through the delicate creations. Val quickly catches a teetering stack of macarons.)*

**VAL**
(Sharp)
Watch it, pal! Those aren’t campaign donations, they’re somebody’s appetizer.

**MARCUS**
(Turning, startled, nearly knocking his chef’s hat off)
Oh! Apologies, ma’am! Just optimizing my spatial awareness within the operational quadrant. I am Marcus Fumble, Personal Executive Assistant to Mr. Reginald Worthington III! And I have been tasked with spearheading the most revolutionary presidential campaign this club has ever witnessed! A campaign of… *flavors*!

*(He gestures grandly with his chef’s hat, almost hitting Beatrice, who ducks.)*

**BEATRICE**
(Eyes wide with horror)
Mr. Fumble! This is the kitchen! For… for cooking! Not… not campaigning!

**MARCUS**
(Chuckling, as if explaining something obvious to a child)
Precisely, Ms. Flutterby! Mr. Worthington’s vision is a paradigm shift! A culinary call to action! We are engaging the palates, the stomachs, the very *gastric fortitude* of the electorate! My instructions were clear: establish campaign headquarters, recruit the best, and prepare a feast of persuasive flavors! And what better place than the very heart of the club’s gastronomic engine?

*(He scans the kitchen, his eyes landing on CHESTER, who has been observing Marcus with a predatory glint in his eye, a new plan already forming.)*

**MARCUS**
(To Chester, confidently)
And you, sir! You must be the renowned Head Chef! Your aura… it practically *sizzles* with culinary genius! Or perhaps the Sommelier Supremo? I detect notes of… aged oak and decisive leadership!

**CHESTER**
(Stepping forward, adjusting his signet ring, his accent now smooth, almost English, but with a hint of something unplaceable)
Indeed, young man. You possess a keen eye for… *excellence*. I am, shall we say, a purveyor of… *refined tastes*. And a consultant in the delicate art of… *social engineering*. But not the cooking kind, you understand. More the… *directing* of the cooking kind.

*(Val rolls her eyes and scribbles furiously on her notepad.)*

**MARCUS**
(Clapping his hands together with delight)
Excellent! Just what we need! Mr. Worthington spoke of a "metaphorical feast" and an "intellectual banquet." I've already secured twenty-seven different culinary teams and the club's actual Head Chef for the *literal* feast, but an "intellectual banquet" requires a… a *Maître d' of Minds*! A strategic orchestrator of perception!

**CHESTER**
(Preening)
Precisely my métier! I have, in my extensive and illustrious career, advised crowned heads and captains of industry on the delicate nuances of public presentation. I possess a unique understanding of the human… *appetite* for influence. My title, in certain circles, is not merely "Count." It is "Grand Arbiter of Esoteric Tastes and Socio-Political Palates."

*(Val snorts, pretending to cough into her hand.)*

**MARCUS**
(Eyes wide with awe)
"Grand Arbiter"! The very title resonates with strategic impact! Mr. Worthington will be thrilled! You, sir, are exactly the high-level brain trust we need to elevate our campaign from mere "gastronomic persuasion" to "holistic prestige implantation"!

*(Marcus fumbles in his briefcase, pulling out a stack of pristine, blank Grandview Heights Social Club letterhead. He finds a pen and, using his briefcase as a makeshift desk, starts writing furiously.)*

**MARCUS**
(Muttering as he writes)
Position: Chief Campaign Advisor for Holistic Prestige Implantation. Duties: Strategic guidance, perception management, palate optimization… Yes! Perfect! We'll call it… the "Flavour of Leadership" initiative!

**BEATRICE**
(Staring at Marcus in utter bewilderment)
But… but he’s Count von Moneystein! He’s a… a *guest*! He can’t be a… a campaign advisor! He’s supposed to be… *being entertained*!

**CHESTER**
(With a charming, disarming smile at Beatrice, then a conspiratorial wink at Marcus, his accent now a blend of charming rogue)
My dear Frau Flutterby, in the grand theatre of life, is not every esteemed guest also a… *performer*? And is not the most exquisite entertainment often found in the most unexpected of… *consulting roles*? Consider it my contribution to the club’s… *cultural enrichment*. And perhaps… a modest retainer might be in order for my… *unique insights*?

**MARCUS**
(Looking up, delighted)
Absolutely! A generous consultation fee is paramount for a "Grand Arbiter"! Consider it done! Mr. Worthington's campaign budget is… robust! He's committed to winning! I’ll just add a line item: "Strategic Gastronomic Enhancement Compensation." It will certainly look impressive on the balance sheet.

*(Marcus tears off the sheet of letterhead, still blank on the back, and hands it to Chester with a flourish.)*

**MARCUS**
Welcome aboard, Grand Arbiter! Together, we shall elevate Mr. Worthington to the presidency on a wave of… *deconstructed vichyssoise and intellectual charisma*!

*(Chester accepts the paper with a magnanimous bow, a triumphant smirk playing on his lips. He glances at Val, who is now openly staring at him, her expression a mix of disgust and fascination. She holds up her notepad slightly, as if threatening him with the information contained within.)*

**VAL**
(Dryly, to Chester)
"Socio-Political Palates," huh? Sounds incredibly… *filling*. Hope you've brought a very large appetite for… *truth*.

**CHESTER**
(Meeting her gaze, his charm unwavering, but with a flicker of challenge in his eyes)
My dear, my appetite is insatiable. And as for truth… is it not often simply a matter of… *perspective*? Especially when one has been paid rather handsomely to shape it?

*(He winks at her. Val narrows her eyes, a new resolve hardening her expression. She quickly jots down a final, emphatic note on her pad.)*

**MARCUS**
(Oblivious, pulling out a small, portable whiteboard from his briefcase)
Right! To the strategic planning! Grand Arbiter, what is our first move in establishing a truly dominant "Gastronomic Leadership Presence"? Should we focus on a macro-culinary approach, perhaps a series of thematic tasting rooms? Or a micro-flavor strategy, utilizing molecular gastronomy to subtly influence voting patterns?

**CHESTER**
(Patting Marcus on the shoulder, now adopting a more serious, authoritative tone)
My young Padawan of Prestige, we must begin with the fundamentals. The *ambience* of ambition. The *aura* of ascendancy. And, most critically, the *disappearance* of any… *inconvenient facts*. First, we must clear this kitchen of… *distractions*. We need a more… *executive* kitchen. Somewhere with fewer… *actual cooks*.

*(He gestures vaguely around the kitchen, implying the real chefs are somehow a hindrance.)*

**MARCUS**
(Nodding sagely)
Brilliant! An Executive Culinary Command Centre! I’ll get right on it! And I’ll have Mr. Worthington's office redesigned into a high-tech "Flavor Fusion Laboratory"!

*(Marcus turns, still clutching his whiteboard, and nearly bowls over a staff member carrying a precarious stack of silver trays. He recovers, stumbles, and then, with newfound purpose, heads for the service door, nearly taking it off its hinges. Chester follows him, casting a final, knowing glance at Val.)*

**CHESTER**
(Over his shoulder, a sardonic smile)
Remember, my dear, appearances are everything. And some performances pay better than others.

*(He exits, Marcus’s excited chatter about "synergistic spice blends" fading as the door swings shut. Val watches them go, then looks at her notepad. She flips to a fresh page and writes "COUNT VON MONEYSTEIN - FAKE. MARCUS - CLUELESS. REGINALD - TARGET #1. CLAUDIA - TARGET #2. THIS CLUB - EXPOSÉ OF THE CENTURY." She looks up, a determined glint in her eye.)*

**VAL**
(To herself, a low, fierce whisper)
Oh, I have an appetite too, Count. And it’s for hypocrisy. And it’s absolutely insatiable.

*(BEATRICE stares after the departed Marcus and Chester, her mouth agape, her clipboard slipping from her grasp and clattering to the floor. She slowly picks it up, stares at the schedule, then at the empty spot where the champagne glasses were. She lets out a small, desperate whimper.)*

**BEATRICE**
(To Val, voice trembling)
Did… did that man just hire a… a European nobleman… to manage a… a gourmet election campaign… in my kitchen?

**VAL**
(Nodding, a grim smile)
Seems so. Welcome to the Grandview Heights Social Club, Beatrice. Where the only thing more fake than the aristocracy is the ambition.

*(Val picks up a stray microgreen from the counter, inspects it, and then flicks it into a bin with a snap. The sound echoes in the sudden quiet of the kitchen. Beatrice clutches her clipboard to her chest, looking like she might burst into tears. The stage is set for a delicious disaster.)*

*(FADE TO BLACK.)*
