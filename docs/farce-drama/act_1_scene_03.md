## ACT 1, SCENE 3

**SETTING:** The VIP Lounge – a haven of faded opulence at the Grandview Heights Social Club. Plush, but slightly threadbare, velvet armchairs and settees are arranged around small, polished tables. Crystal chandeliers hang a little askew. One wall features an enormous, rather unflattering portrait of a stern-looking CLUB FOUNDER, whose eyes seem to follow the characters with perpetual disapproval. Half-empty champagne flutes and delicate canapé plates dot the tables.

**(AT RISE):** CLAUDIA UPPINGTON, resplendent in a shimmering lilac power suit, sits regally on a central settee, her tiny dog, PRUNELLA, a fluffy white menace, peeking out from a diamond-studded purse on her lap. Her affected aristocratic accent is in full flow as she holds court, gesturing elegantly with a diamond-encrusted hand. Across from her, SOCIETY MEMBER 1 (MRS. PENNYWEIGHT), a woman perpetually clutching a fan, and SOCIETY MEMBER 2 (MR. DITHER), a man with a nervous tic, nod attentively.

BEATRICE FLUTTERBY bustles between tables, her clipboard a shield against the mounting chaos, muttering to herself and occasionally attempting to straighten a wonky vase of lilies. Her movements are jerky, a bird caught in a cage.

In a quiet corner, FREDDY MONTAGUE is slumped comfortably in an armchair, appearing far too relaxed. He wears a casual linen jacket and looks like he's genuinely enjoying a moment of peace, perhaps reading the financial section of a newspaper he holds.

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Airily, to Mrs. Pennyweight)
> And that, my dear Penelope, is precisely why the Grandview Heights Social Club – once the *apex* of metropolitan sophistication – is now teetering on the precipice of… well, of *decadence*. Just last week, I spotted a member wearing… *polyester*. Imagine!

<center>MRS. PENNYWEIGHT</center>
> (Fanning herself vigorously)
> The horror! It sends shivers down my... *décolletage*.

<center>MR. DITHER</center>
> (Twitching)
> Indeed, indeed. Standards are… plummeting. Like a… a… plummet.

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> Exactly! One simply *must* have a strong hand at the helm. Someone with vision. Someone with… *pedigree*. Someone who understands the delicate art of… *social curation*.

<center>BEATRICE</center>
> (Spotting a speck of dust on a table)
> Oh, for goodness sakes, not *more* dust. The linen napkins are meant to be *pressed*, not *creased*! This isn't a laundromat, it's… it's… the VIP Lounge!
> (She fumbles with her clipboard, nearly dropping it.)
> Order! We need order!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Ignoring Beatrice, patting Prunella)
> Don’t worry, darling Prunella. Mummy will restore equilibrium. Mummy knows *exactly* what this club needs.

<center>PRUNELLA</center>
> (A tiny, surprisingly aggressive yip)
> Yip!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (To Prunella, in a cooing baby voice)
> Yes, my sweet. Mummy is the only one fit to lead. *Snuggums* knows it.

<center>MRS. PENNYWEIGHT</center>
> The presidency, surely, Claudia, is yours for the taking. No one else has your… *gravitas*.

<center>MR. DITHER</center>
> No one. No one.

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (A faux-modest sigh)
> Well, one does one's best. But frankly, the thought of any *other* candidate… it simply beggars belief. The very thought sends a tremor through my… (She searches for the word, then lands on it with a flourish) …*dignified spleen*.

**(Claudia’s gaze falls upon Freddy Montague, who has just set down his newspaper and is stretching languidly. His casual attire stands out amongst the well-dressed elite.)**

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (To Freddy, with an imperious flick of her wrist)
> You! Yes, you in the… rather crumpled jacket. This champagne flute is practically empty. And where are the olives? The *imported* olives, mind you.

<center>FREDDY</center>
> (Calmly, a faint smile playing on his lips)
> I assure you, ma'am, I am not…

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Interrupting, without looking at him)
> No excuses! This is a five-star establishment, not a… a common tavern! Fetch more! And quickly, before my *prestige* evaporates.

<center>FREDDY</center>
> (Shrugs good-naturedly, stands up slowly)
> Very well. If it means so much to you.

**(Freddy ambles off, a picture of ironic amusement, toward a side door. Beatrice, flustered, nearly collides with him.)**

<center>BEATRICE</center>
> (Waving her clipboard frantically)
> Oh, watch out! Careful, careful! The canapés are precisely timed! The miniature quiches have a *very* specific thermal window! If they get cold, it's utter anarchy! Utter!

**(Just as Beatrice recovers her balance, the double doors to the VIP Lounge burst open with a flourish. REGINALD WORTHINGTON III strides in, chest puffed out, head held high, his toupee noticeably askew. He is flanked by CHESTER BLUFF, who now sports a rather theatrical, twirled mustache and carries a slim, leather-bound volume that looks suspiciously like a prop. Chester’s current accent leans heavily towards a 'refined' German-Swiss.)**

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Booming, to no one in particular)
> Greetings, fellow arbiters of taste! The future has arrived, and it is… *magnificently coiffed*!

**(He gestures grandly to his own head, then pats his toupee, which slides further to the right. Chester subtly nudges it back into place with the edge of his prop book.)**

<center>CHESTER</center>
> (With a guttural purr)
> Indeed. Herr Worthington brings not merely a vision, but a *gestalt*! A powerful, invigorating *gestalt* for ze club’s future!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Her jaw practically drops, her eyes narrowing)
> Reginald! What in heaven’s name is *this* spectacle? And who, pray tell, is this… *gentleman*? He smells faintly of desperation and eau de toilette.

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Smiling smugly, ignoring the dig)
> Claudia, my dear, allow me to introduce my… my *eminence grise*, my strategical *connoisseur*, my… Count von Moneystein! He is my Chief Campaign Advisor for Holistic Prestige Implantation! And he has been painstakingly *curated* for the specific purpose of elevating my presidential bid to an unprecedented *altitude of aspiration*!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Scoffs, an elegant sneer)
> Moneystein? Never heard of him. Sounds like something one might find in a novelty gift shop. And *Chief Campaign Advisor for Holistic Prestige Implantation*? Did you pull that from a fortune cookie, Reginald?

<center>CHESTER</center>
> (Bowing deeply, his accent shifting subtly towards Austro-Hungarian)
> Ah, the esteemed Frau Uppington! A pleasure to make your acquaintance. My family lineage, alas, predates such… *ephemeral* establishments as your ‘fortune cookie’. We are more of the… *Alpine-agrarian banking dynasty* persuasion. Very old money. Very *very* old.

<center>PRUNELLA</center>
> (Barks furiously from Claudia’s purse at Chester, as if sensing a rival charlatan.)
> Yip! Yip! Yip!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Calming Prunella)
> Prunella, darling, don't waste your precious vocalizations on… *imposters*.

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Eyes bulging slightly, adjusting his toupee again, making it slip the *other* way)
> Imposter? Nonsense, Claudia! Count von Moneystein is a genius! He understands the *nuance* of societal *proclivity*! He’s convinced me that my campaign slogan should be…
> (He pulls a scroll from his jacket pocket, unrolls it with a flourish.)
> …"Reginald Worthington III: The Zenith of Your Zest!"

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Gasps, a genuine look of horror crossing her face)
> "Zenith of Your Zest?!" Reginald, that sounds like a particularly potent laxative! Or a cheap energy drink for octogenarians!

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Deflating slightly, then regaining his bluster)
> It’s… it’s *evocative*! It’s *dynamic*! The Count says it speaks to the… the *inner effervescence* of the modern socialite!

<center>CHESTER</center>
> (Nodding gravely, his accent now distinctly French, with a hint of Transylvanian)
> *Oui*, Monsieur Worthington possesses ze… ze *joie de vivre*! Ze *élan vital*! Ze… ze *glorious effulgence*! It will resonate deeply wiz ze masses! Ze… ze *hoi polloi* of ze high society!

<center>BEATRICE</center>
> (Fluttering past, clipboard a whirlwind)
> Resonate? Oh dear, I hope not! The acoustics in the Grand Ballroom are already problematic enough without any… *effulgence*! The caterers are arguing about the correct angle for the mini-meatballs! The mini-meatballs!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Standing, Prunella still in her purse, facing Reginald down)
> Reginald, let us be *crystal* clear. This presidency is mine. I have cultivated this club for decades. I have endured countless tiresome charity galas, feigned interest in amateur operettas, and even *hosted* a luncheon for the mayor’s particularly dull nephew! I have earned this!

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Matching her intensity, toupee quivering)
> And I, Claudia, have spent a lifetime *amassing* the social capital required to shepherd this institution into a new era of… of *unfettered philanthropy*! My vision is one of… of *palatial benevolence*! A veritable *cornucopia of convivial connectivity*!

<center>MRS. PENNYWEIGHT</center>
> (Fanning herself faster)
> Palatial benevolence! Oh, my!

<center>MR. DITHER</center>
> Connectivity! My heart… it twitches!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Turns to Chester, scrutinizing him)
> And you, Count… *Moneystein*. Just what exactly is your *provenance*? Where is this… *Alpine-agrarian banking dynasty*? I'm quite certain I would have heard of a family of such… *effulgence*.

<center>CHESTER</center>
> (Sweating slightly, he tries a thick Scottish accent)
> Ah, aye, lass, 'tis a wee bit o' a private affair. We keep tae ourselves, ya ken? Verra exclusive. Like a secret haggis recipe. Full o' ancient secrets!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Raises an eyebrow, unconvinced)
> A secret *haggis* recipe? Just moments ago, you were speaking of Viennese *gestalt* and French *joie de vivre*. Now it's… *haggis*? Your accent is fluctuating more wildly than my stock portfolio during a market crash.

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Interjecting, trying to save face)
> The Count is merely demonstrating his… his *poly-linguistic dexterity*, Claudia! It's a sign of true continental sophistication! He's a man of many… *vociferous talents*!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Scoffs, turning her back to Reginald, whispering conspiratorially to Mrs. Pennyweight and Mr. Dither)
> This is a direct assault on everything I've built. That ridiculous man and his… *charlatan du jour*! We simply cannot allow it. This calls for… a strategy. A *discreet* strategy.
> (She pats Prunella, who yaps once more.)
> Mummy’s going to have to get her paws dirty.

**(Freddy re-enters, carrying a silver tray with olives and a fresh champagne flute. He approaches Claudia.)**

<center>FREDDY</center>
> (Politely)
> Your olives, ma'am. And a refill.

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Snatching the glass, not looking at him)
> Finally! Took you long enough. And these olives look suspiciously… *domestic*. I distinctly requested Kalamata! Go find the *imported* ones! And perhaps, while you’re at it, find a more appropriate tie. You look rather… *unfettered*.

<center>FREDDY</center>
> (Looks at his perfectly fine tie, then at the imported olives on the tray, a smirk on his face)
> As you wish, ma'am. Unfettered, indeed.

**(Freddy turns to leave, just as Beatrice, in a panicked rush, drops her clipboard, sending a flurry of papers flying. One sheet lands directly at Reginald’s feet, emblazoned with a diagram of "Optimal Toupee Placement." Another lands near Chester, titled "Basic Con Artist Accent Practice.")**

<center>BEATRICE</center>
> (Wringing her hands)
> Oh, dear! Oh, help! The schedules! The guest list! The… the seating chart for the vegan options! It’s all gone to pot! Utter chaos!

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Bending down, spotting the toupee diagram. He picks it up, stares at it in confusion.)
> What is this… "Optimal Toupee Placement: The Worthington Method"? Did you… did you commission this, Count? For my… my *cranium of distinction*?

<center>CHESTER</center>
> (Quickly snatching the "Accent Practice" sheet before anyone else can see it, improvising a vague Russian accent)
> Ah, yes, Reginald, my dear boy! Is part of ze *comprehensive image re-calibration*! Very scientific! Very… *top-secret*. Ze secrets of ze perfect presidential profile!

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (Seeing Reginald with the diagram, she throws her head back and laughs, a brittle, triumphant sound)
> Oh, Reginald, you truly are a clown! "Optimal Toupee Placement"? What next, a detailed analysis of your… *lifted heels*?

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Blushing furiously beneath his make-up, adjusting his toupee which now sits squarely on his left ear)
> That is highly uncalled for, Claudia! This is a matter of… of *strategic grooming*!

<center>PRUNELLA</center>
> (Seeing Reginald's skewed toupee as a small, fluffy animal, she leaps from Claudia’s purse with a furious yelp and attempts to attack it, barking wildly.)
> Yip! Yip! GRRRRR!

<center>REGINALD</center>
> (Screaming)
> My coiffure! It’s under siege!

**(Reginald flails, trying to fend off the tiny, ferocious dog. Chester attempts to grab Prunella, missing wildly, nearly hitting Reginald’s nose. Beatrice dives for her scattered papers, tripping over her own feet. Freddy watches the pandemonium with an unruffled smile, quietly picking up a stray olive from the floor and popping it into his mouth. Claudia, meanwhile, is beaming, already plotting her next move.)**

<center>CLAUDIA</center>
> (To herself, smugly, as Reginald battles the dog)
> Oh, this is going to be far easier than I thought.

**(The CLUB FOUNDER’s portrait on the wall shudders slightly, a fine layer of dust sifting down onto the chaotic scene below. Reginald yelps as Prunella makes a direct hit on his toupee, dislodging it completely. It lands with a soft THWUMP at Claudia's feet.)**

**(Reginald, now bald and red-faced, stares in horror at his fallen hairpiece. Chester freezes, his "Moneystein" persona momentarily shattered. Claudia smiles sweetly, Prunella proudly wagging her tail at her side.)**

<center>BEATRICE</center>
> (Eyes wide with dread, surrounded by scattered papers)
> Oh, my! Oh, the humanity! This is… this is… an *act of God*!

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**
