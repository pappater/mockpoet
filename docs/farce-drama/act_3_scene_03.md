**ACT 3, SCENE 3**

**SETTING:** The Grand Ballroom. The air is still faintly smoky, and the remnants of the earlier chaos — a fallen chandelier, a pile of overturned champagne flutes, a single rubber chicken – are hastily swept into corners. A makeshift voting booth, surprisingly elaborate with velvet ropes and a "VOTE HERE FOR PRESIDENTIAL GLORY" banner, stands center stage. An enormous, old-fashioned lever voting machine, a relic from a bygone era, looms beside it.

*BEATRICE enters, looking utterly spent, her clipboard now missing most of its pages. She clutches the last remaining sheet to her chest like a shield. She stares at the voting machine with dread. MARCUS follows, still babbling into a non-existent microphone.*

MARCUS
…and so, as the dust settles on the post-modernist societal performance, we prepare for the ultimate democratic deconstruction! A vote, not merely for leadership, but for the very *essence* of our collective unconscious! Who will shepherd the herd of humanity through the turbulent waters of… whatever this is?

*REGINALD enters, looking strangely vulnerable without his toupee, but holding his head a little higher thanks to PENELOPE, who walks beside him, her expression a mix of exasperation and cautious pride. CLAUDIA sweeps in behind them, FIFI clutched to her chest, glaring daggers at Reginald.*

CLAUDIA
(To Reginald, a hissed whisper)
Don't think your little bald-headed confessional will sway anyone, Reginald. Authenticity is a *trend*, dear. One I predict will be *over* by cocktail hour. My "competitive philanthropy" will resonate with the true patrons of prestige!

REGINALD
(Adjusting his head, a phantom gesture for his toupee)
Penelope says… one must be oneself. A terrifying prospect, I admit. But… I felt a strange lightness, Claudia. A… liberation from the follicular tyranny.

PENELOPE
(A gentle but firm nudge)
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Dad. One small step towards self-awareness. Now, let's just get this vote over with.

*VAL is observing from a distance, notepad still out, but her pen hovers. CHESTER, ever the showman, has managed to acquire a new, even more outlandish fake mustache, which he twirls with a flourish. He saunters towards them.*

CHESTER
Ah, the crucible of democracy! Such drama, such intrigue! One might almost forget the charred remains of the buffet! *Almost*.

CLAUDIA
(Sniffing disdainfully)
You, Count Bluff, have no business here. Your deception has stained the very velvet of this establishment!

CHESTER
(Bows with exaggerated grace)
Stained, perhaps, but also… *illuminated*. I merely provided the canvas upon which your magnificent self-deceptions could truly shine! You're welcome, by the way.

*FREDDY enters from a side door, still in his somewhat casual attire, carrying a small, perfectly polished silver tray with a single glass of water. He's been observing. Beatrice sees him.*

BEATRICE
(Eyes wide with panic)
Oh, Mr… Mr. Waiter! Thank goodness! The voting apparatus… it's… it's blinking red! And the manual is in Sanskrit!

FREDDY
(Calmly places the tray on a nearby table)
Just Freddy, Beatrice. And it's not Sanskrit. It's an old Westinghouse from '72. Probably needs a good whack.

*He casually taps the side of the large voting machine. It sputters, then a series of flashing lights and whistles erupt, followed by a stentorian, automated voice.*

AUTOMATED VOICE
(Deep, resonant, slightly distorted)
WELCOME TO THE GRANDVIEW HEIGHTS SOCIAL CLUB PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. PLEASE INSERT YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD TO ACTIVATE YOUR VOTE. CAUTION: INITIATING VOTE CASTING WILL SECURE YOUR SELECTION WITH UNYIELDING FINALITY. NO REFUNDS. NO RETRIES.

CLAUDIA
(Gasps, clutching Fifi)
Unyielding Finality? This isn't a commitment to a new car, it's a social appointment!

REGINALD
(Straining to see over Claudia)
Where do I insert the card? There's a slot here marked "Sacrificial Lamb." Is that… customary?

PENELOPE
(Pinching the bridge of her nose)
Dad, no. That's for the old initiation rites. Probably best to avoid that.

MARCUS
(Excitedly)
Ah, the gamification of civic duty! A brilliant conceptualization of engagement metrics! Is there a leaderboard? A micro-transaction option for extra influence?

BEATRICE
(Wringing her hands)
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! The system is meant to be foolproof! This is all because of the conflagration! And the dog! And Mr. Worthington’s… toupee situation!

*She gestures vaguely at Reginald’s head, then quickly retracts her hand.*

REGINALD
(Stiffens)
My *situation* is no longer a situation, Beatrice! It is… a natural state of being! A glorious, unadorned declaration of… scalp!

*CLAUDIA shoves past Reginald, pulling a bedazzled membership card from her purse.*

CLAUDIA
Move aside, Reginald. The club needs a steady hand, a discerning eye, and a perfectly coiffed sensibility. And Fifi agrees! Don't you, my darling?

*FIFI barks weakly, then sneezes.*

CLAUDIA
(Forcefully shoves her card into a slot labeled "Elite Access")
There! One vote for progress! One vote for status! One vote for me!

AUTOMATED VOICE
(Calmly)
VOTE RECEIVED: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY.

*A collective gasp. Claudia freezes, her hand still in the slot. Fifi yelps.*

CLAUDIA
(Slowly pulls her hand back, utterly stunned)
What? No. No, that's impossible! I voted for… for *me*! The card is clearly imprinted with CLAUDIA UPPINGTON, Grand Dame Extraordinaire!

FREDDY
(Chuckles softly)
That slot, Claudia, is actually for the 'Proxy Vote for Club Employees'. It's a rather antiquated rule, meant to give staff a voice. The system defaults to the person who spent the most time trying to fix it. Which, by my observation, was Beatrice.

BEATRICE
(Gasps, looking at Freddy, then at the machine)
Me? But… I was just… trying to find the off button!

REGINALD
(Pushes past Claudia, momentarily forgetting his toupee woes)
This is an outrage! My speech, my newfound… authenticity! It was all for naught? No! This system is clearly rigged!

*He shoves his card into a slot marked "Honorable Member".*

AUTOMATED VOICE
VOTE RECEIVED: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY.

REGINALD
(Stares blankly at the machine)
Beatrice? Again? But… but I distinctly remember selecting "Reginald Worthington III, Bringer of New Dawn!"

PENELOPE
(To Freddy)
What was that slot?

FREDDY
(Shrugs good-naturedly)
Oh, that's the 'Legacy Member Accidental Override'. It defaults to the longest-serving club member. Which, I believe, is Beatrice. She's been here since it was a pigeon coop.

BEATRICE
(Faints delicately, but still holding her single clipboard page, right into MARCUS’s arms. Marcus stumbles, nearly dropping her.)

MARCUS
(Caught off guard, juggling Beatrice)
Whoa! Incoming human resource! Is this an emergency transfer of leadership protocols? Or a sudden, performative collapse for strategic advantage?

VAL
(Eyes wide, scribbling furiously)
This is… incredible. The machine's essentially a sentient joke.

CHESTER
(Applauding softly)
Bravo! A truly inspired piece of electoral theatre! The ultimate irony – the system itself subverts the will of the… well, the *self-appointed* will, anyway.

*Other bewildered club members, who have been milling about, now approach the voting machine, inserting their cards, all resulting in the same announcement.*

AUTOMATED VOICE
VOTE RECEIVED: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY.
VOTE RECEIVED: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY.
VOTE RECEIVED: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY.

*The sound becomes a cacophony of "BEATRICE FLUTTERBY" announcements. CLAUDIA is practically vibrating with indignation. REGINALD looks utterly deflated.*

CLAUDIA
This is an unmitigated disaster! A social suicide! The Grandview Heights Social Club, presided over by… by the events coordinator?! It’s like putting the dog walker in charge of the pedigree show!

*FIFI growls from her purse.*

PENELOPE
(To her father, gently)
Dad, it’s okay. Maybe it’s not the worst thing. She actually… works here.

REGINALD
(Sighs dramatically)
But my legacy! My aspiration! To be just… Reginald. I had hoped to be President Reginald. A subtle but crucial difference!

*MARCUS has finally set BEATRICE down, who is slowly coming to.*

BEATRICE
(Groggily)
Did… did anyone get the number of that truck? And where is my last clipboard page?

*She looks up to see the voting machine still blaring her name.*

AUTOMATED VOICE
FINAL VOTE COUNT: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY: 100%. PRESIDENT-ELECT: BEATRICE FLUTTERBY. CONGRATULATIONS. MAY YOUR PAPERCLIPS BE EVER SHARP.

BEATRICE
(Screams faintly, then buries her face in her hands)
No! Oh, no, no, NO! I just wanted to get through one event without a disaster! Not *become* the disaster!

*A few scattered claps begin from the remaining club members, mostly out of bewildered amusement. FREDDY claps genuinely.*

FREDDY
Well, Beatrice, congratulations! I think you'll do an excellent job. You're the only one who actually knows how this place runs.

CLAUDIA
(Turns on Freddy, outraged)
You! You engineered this, didn't you, Mr. Waiter? Using your intimate knowledge of antiquated machinery to place your… *henchwoman* on the throne!

FREDDY
(A wry smile)
Hardly. And I'm not a waiter, Claudia. Just Freddy. And I happen to own the company that *makes* these absurd voting machines. Been meaning to upgrade the club's tech for years, but nobody ever listens to the "staff."

*Claudia's jaw drops. Her eyes widen as she finally processes who Freddy is. Fifi makes a small, bewildered noise.*

CLAUDIA
(A strangled whisper)
You… you’re *that* Freddy Montague? The tech billionaire? The one who bought out the entire block of Park Avenue?!

FREDDY
One and the same. Now, about that party… seems like we have something to celebrate. Or at least, something to toast to. A new era, perhaps? One where the person who tidies up actually gets to call the shots.

*He winks at Beatrice, who is still in a state of shock, muttering about "paperwork" and "inventory."*

PENELOPE
(To Reginald, a genuine smile now)
See, Dad? Sometimes the most unexpected outcome is the most… right.

REGINALD
(Looks at Penelope, then at Beatrice, then at his own bare head. A tiny, almost imperceptible smile touches his lips.)
Perhaps. Perhaps a President who actually knows where the emergency exit is… is not the worst thing. And… you know what? My head does feel rather… aerodynamic.

*He pats his scalp proudly. Penelope hugs him, a rare moment of genuine affection.*

VAL
(Closing her notepad, a thoughtful expression)
You know, I came here to write a scathing exposé. About the absurdities, the pretenses, the sheer ridiculousness of it all. But… maybe it’s not just about that. Maybe it’s about the very human need to belong, even if we create the most elaborate, idiotic systems to achieve it.

*She looks at Chester, who returns her gaze with a charming, roguish smile. He then takes a dramatic bow for the "crowd" (the few remaining, bewildered club members).*

CHESTER
My work here is done, Ms. Sharp. I have held up the mirror, and the reflection, however grotesque, was entirely their own. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I hear there’s an opera company in need of a dramatic tenor… and a substantial loan.

*Just then, two burly SECURITY GUARDS, looking somewhat confused, enter and approach Chester.*

SECURITY GUARD 1
Excuse me, sir. We've received a report about a… 'Count von Moneystein' who may have forgotten to settle his bar tab for the last three months, and possibly several vintage champagne fountains.

CHESTER
(Gasps dramatically)
My good men, there must be some mistake! I merely borrowed the champagne for an impromptu *performance art piece* to illustrate the ephemeral nature of wealth! It was all part of the… (His accent shifts rapidly from French to German to vaguely Irish) …*grand design*! A social experiment, you understand!

SECURITY GUARD 2
(Checks his clipboard, which looks remarkably similar to Beatrice’s original)
Uh-huh. And the fake mustache you left on the dog? That was art too?

CHESTER
(Suddenly very still, then grins)
Ah, that was a commentary on canine complicity in aristocratic deception! Highly avant-garde!

*The guards gently but firmly take Chester's arms. As they escort him towards an exit, CHESTER catches VAL’s eye. He winks, then blows her a kiss. Val rolls her eyes but can’t quite hide a small smile.*

VAL
(To herself)
"The human need for belonging…" And the persistent need for a good story.

MARCUS
(Suddenly snaps his fingers, his eyes wide with profound realization)
I’ve got it! This is it! The meta-narrative! Beatrice is the apotheosis of the everywoman, thrust into a position of unexpected authority by the very systems designed to exclude her! It’s a Hegelian dialectic of the corporate subconscious! An inverted meritocracy!

*He begins furiously typing on his imaginary keyboard, then claps his hands together.*

MARCUS
This calls for a celebration! A new paradigm of social interaction! Should I order the coq au vin again? I seem to have the recipe handy…

FREDDY
(To Beatrice, extending a hand)
How about we just order some pizza, Beatrice? And call it a party. For the new President.

BEATRICE
(Still dazed, but a tiny spark of determination flickers in her eyes as she looks around the chaotic ballroom)
Pizza… Yes. And then, we'll need to reorganize the linen closet. And update the fire safety protocols. And perhaps replace that ridiculous voting machine. With something that actually works!

*She looks at Freddy with a newfound authority, then back at her crumpled, solitary clipboard page, and straightens her shoulders. She is the accidental president, and she's already making a to-do list. The absurdity of her ascent is complete.*

*CLAUDIA stares at her, aghast, then at Fifi. REGINALD looks at Penelope, a genuine, albeit still slightly confused, smile.*

REGINALD
So, I’m just… Reginald. And Beatrice is President. What a world.

PENELOPE
(Squeezes his hand)
What a wonderfully absurd world, Dad.

*The sound of CHESTER's dramatic, muffled protests fades from offstage. Marcus is still explaining his "Hegelian dialectic" to a potted plant. Claudia is whispering furiously to Fifi about new "authenticity-themed" charities. The voting machine quietly whirs, the sound of "BEATRICE FLUTTERBY" still faintly echoing.*
