[SCENE START]

**ACT 1, SCENE 1**

**SETTING:** REGINALD WORTHINGTON III's opulent, yet slightly gaudy, executive office at Pinnacle Solutions Corp. The room is overly decorated with dark wood paneling, heavy velvet curtains, and framed certificates of questionable provenance. A large, imposing mahogany desk dominates the center, cluttered with various "leadership" books, a half-eaten Danish, and a silver-framed photo of Reginald shaking hands with a blurry, unrecognizable dignitary. On one wall hangs a massive, slightly askew portrait of Reginald himself, looking stern and self-important. Several empty champagne bottles are discreetly tucked behind a tall, fake potted palm. Sunlight streams weakly through the large window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

At rise, REGINALD WORTHINGTON III, 55, stands behind his desk, chest puffed out, attempting to straighten an already perfectly straight tie. His expensive suit seems to strain at the seams. His toupee, a surprisingly convincing edifice of dark brown hair, is only slightly off-kilter. MARCUS FUMBLE, 35, Reginald's assistant, stands ramrod straight opposite him, clutching an overflowing briefcase and a stack of color-coded binders.

REGINALD
(Clears his throat with a booming resonance that echoes slightly too long in the room)
Marcus, my dear boy, the hour is nigh. The planets align. The very zeitgeist of our social firmament demands action!

MARCUS
(Nodding vigorously, eyes wide with earnest concentration)
Action, sir! I have cross-referenced all the Q3 synergy reports. Our KPIs are... (He fumbles with a binder, nearly dropping it) ...optimally positioned for maximum stakeholder engagement!

REGINALD
(Waving a dismissive hand, nearly dislodging a small, decorative globe from his desk)
Synergy! KPIs! My dear Marcus, we are not discussing quarterly profits – a mere pittance in the grand scheme. We are discussing *legacy*! *Stature*! The very apex of metropolitan social stratification!

MARCUS
(Confused, but eager to please)
Ah, social stratification! So, a new corporate restructuring initiative? Shall I draft a memo on revised seating arrangements for the cafeteria? We could tier it, sir. Executive tier, management tier, then... (He gestures vaguely downwards) ...the other tiers.

REGINALD
(Leans across the desk, lowering his voice conspiratorially, though it still booms)
Marcus, you obtuse angel of administrative chaos! I speak of the Grandview Heights Social Club! The crucible of influence! The very beating heart of this city's elite! And I, Reginald Worthington the Third, shall become its President!

MARCUS
(Gasps, dropping his briefcase with a resounding thud that makes the desk lamp wobble dangerously)
President! Of the entire Social Club? Sir, that's... that's a whole other level of corporate ladder! Do they have stock options? Health benefits?

REGINALD
(Sighs dramatically, adjusting his toupee with a practiced, furtive pat. It shifts slightly to the left)
Marcus, please. This isn't about mere emoluments. This is about dominion! About being the undisputed titan of taste, the arbiter of aristocracy, the... the *Grand Panjandrum* of polite society!

MARCUS
(Picking up his scattered papers, bumping his head on the desk)
Grand Panjandrum. Got it. Is that a new executive title, sir? Should I update your business cards?

REGINALD
(Ignoring him, pacing dramatically)
I need a campaign, Marcus. A veritable *tour de force*! Something that will sweep away the competition, particularly that simpering harridan, Claudia Uppington. She thinks her poodle and her inherited wealth make her a queen! Ha! I shall show her!

MARCUS
(Scrambling to write notes, pen squeaking)
Campaign! Right. So, aggressive marketing? Print ads? Social media blitz? I can start a TikTok account for the "Grand Panjandrum of Polite Society"! We could do unboxing videos of your... (He gestures to Reginald's general attire) ...your accoutrements!

REGINALD
(Stops pacing abruptly, spinning to face Marcus, nearly tripping over the fake palm)
TikTok? Marcus, are you quite mad? This is the Grandview Heights Social Club, not some digital bazaar for fidget spinners! We require finesse! Subtlety! A touch of the *je ne sais quoi*!

MARCUS
(Frowning, genuinely perplexed)
Je ne sais quoi? Is that a new demographic we're targeting? French-speaking elites? I'll get the translation software ready.

REGINALD
(Pinches the bridge of his nose, pushing his toupee further askew)
No, Marcus, no! We need to *mobilize the electorate*! We need to *feed their discerning palates*! We need to ensure that every club member, from the lowliest dilettante to the most exalted doyenne, understands that Reginald Worthington III is the only choice! The *inevitable* choice!

MARCUS
(His eyes light up with sudden understanding, a brilliant (to him) realization)
Ah! "Feed their discerning palates"! Sir, I knew it! A *gastronomic* campaign! That's brilliant! We won't just *win* them over, we'll *dine* them over! A veritable feast of persuasive flavors!

REGINALD
(Beaming, oblivious to the deeper misunderstanding)
Precisely, Marcus! You grasp my vision! The metaphorical feast! The intellectual banquet of ideas!

MARCUS
(Scribbling furiously)
Metaphorical... intellectual... got it. So, a fusion menu? Perhaps a deconstructed Caesar salad to represent the fragmentation of societal norms, then a robust beef Wellington to symbolize your unwavering strength! And for dessert, something light, airy, yet profoundly complex, like a matcha soufflé, for the future of the club!

REGINALD
(Looks at Marcus, a flicker of confusion crossing his face, but quickly dismisses it as Marcus's "creative interpretation")
Yes, yes, Marcus! The culinary metaphors are quite... evocative. Just ensure the message is clear: Reginald Worthington III is the most *savory* choice for President! Now, to business. The annual gala is in two weeks. That is where the vote will occur. I need you to establish a *campaign headquarters*. Immediately! Think organization, efficiency, meticulous execution!

MARCUS
(Snapping to attention, nearly saluting)
Consider it done, sir! I'll secure the largest kitchen space available! Central location, maximum preparation area! I’ll need a team, of course. Chefs, sous chefs, pastry specialists, a sommelier for the *intellectual banquet*!

REGINALD
(Waving him off, already turning to admire his portrait)
Excellent, Marcus, excellent! Just ensure it's discreet, yet impactful. No ostentatious displays. We are sophisticated, not sensationalist. Now, I have a speech to compose. Something that will resonate with the very soul of the Grandview Heights Social Club! Something about... "the historical tapestry woven with threads of philanthropic endeavor and refined libations!" Yes!

[REGINALD begins to mumble to himself, striking various statesman-like poses in front of his portrait. His toupee has now migrated to a rakish angle, giving him an unexpectedly avant-garde look.]

MARCUS
(Collecting his briefcases and binders with renewed vigor, muttering to himself as he heads for the door)
Discreet yet impactful kitchen space... Got it. I know just the place. The Grandview Heights Social Club’s main kitchen. Perfect! And for the "historical tapestry," maybe some artisanal bread woven into actual tapestries? With edible threads! This is going to be the most delicious campaign ever!

[MARCUS, still muttering, opens the office door and nearly collides with PENELOPE PRIM, 32, Reginald's daughter, who stands on the threshold, a look of weary exasperation already etched on her face. She rolls her eyes the moment she sees her father’s toupee.]

PENELOPE
(Dryly)
Ah, Marcus. Still valiantly attempting to decipher my father's unique brand of corporate-speak, I see. What grand delusion has he cooked up now? And why do you look like you're about to cater a royal wedding?

MARCUS
(Beaming proudly)
Penelope! Just the person! Your father has entrusted me with the most critical mission of his career! I'm organizing his presidential campaign for the Grandview Heights Social Club! It's a culinary campaign! A feast of ideas!

PENELOPE
(Her eyebrow raises several inches)
A *culinary* campaign. Right. Because that's exactly what the Grandview Heights Social Club needs. More cream cheese blinis.

REGINALD
(Turns, momentarily flustered to see Penelope. He hastily tries to pat his toupee back into place, but only succeeds in pushing it further over one eye, making him look like a piratical dignitary)
Penelope, darling! What an unexpected... synchronicity! Marcus, do excuse us. Urgent family matters. Something about... the upkeep of the Worthington ancestral mausoleum! Very pressing!

MARCUS
(Taking this literally)
Mausoleum upkeep? Sir, I’ll add it to the campaign budget! Perhaps a small, tasteful buffet for the deceased ancestors? A respectful spread?

REGINALD
(Waving him off frantically)
Just... go, Marcus! Go forth and... strategize your comestibles!

[MARCUS nods, bumps into the doorframe on his way out, then quickly disappears, leaving the door ajar.]

PENELOPE
(Shakes her head, then fixes her father with a stern look)
Ancestral mausoleum, Dad? Really? That's the best you could come up with? I heard about your latest "presidential bid" from Aunt Mildred, who heard it from her manicurist, who apparently overheard you bellowing about "social supremacy" at the golf course.

REGINALD
(Sighs dramatically, taking off his askew toupee and placing it carefully on a bust of a Roman emperor on his desk, revealing a surprisingly bald head beneath)
(His voice instantly loses some of its theatrical bluster)
Penelope. Must you always burst my bubble of... strategic enthusiasm? This is important. This is my chance! My chance to finally be recognized, to rub shoulders with the true titans, not just the glorified plumbers who pass for executives these days!

PENELOPE
(Crosses her arms, unimpressed)
Recognized for what, Dad? For being the most ostentatious, self-aggrandizing member who insists on having "Worthington" etched into everything from the silverware to the golf carts? You're already famous for that.

REGINALD
(Wrings his hands, suddenly looking vulnerable without the toupee)
But it's different now, darling. This is the presidency! It's respect! It's... it's a legacy for *us*! For the Worthington name! Think of the invitations! The exclusive galas! The sheer *gravitas*!

PENELOPE
(Walks over to the desk, picks up the toupee and gently, almost instinctively, straightens it before placing it back on the bust)
Dad, you have more money than God, a corporation you barely run, and a lifetime achievement award from the local Chamber of Commerce that you bought yourself. What you don't have is... well, *honesty*. Or genuine respect.

REGINALD
(Scoffs, but a flicker of insecurity crosses his face)
Honesty? What has honesty ever done for anyone in this city, except get them audited? No, Penelope, in this world, you craft your image. You build your persona. It’s a performance!

PENELOPE
(Looks at him, her expression softening slightly)
And what if, for once, you didn't? What if you actually tried to be... you? The real you? Not the caricature. I might actually be proud of that.

REGINALD
(Stares at her, genuinely surprised by the suggestion)
The real me? But... but who is that? I haven't seen him in decades! He was probably wearing an ill-fitting sweater and reading sensible novels!

PENELOPE
(A small, wry smile plays on her lips)
If you want my help, Dad – and I can get this mess with Marcus straightened out, probably prevent a health code violation – then you have to try. No more grand lies. No more exaggerations. Just... Reginald. And if you win, great. If you don't, at least you’ll know you did it on your own terms.

REGINALD
(Hesitates, looking from his daughter to the toupee on the bust, then to his own portrait. He takes a deep breath, and then slowly, cautiously, reaches for his toupee)
You... you would help me? Truly? Without the usual... eye-rolls?

PENELOPE
(Nods)
I’m here, aren’t I? But only if you promise. No more outrageous fabrications. At least, not *intentionally*. We can't control what Marcus does.

REGINALD
(Puts the toupee back on, this time deliberately placing it straight and centered. He still looks pompous, but perhaps a touch less ridiculous)
(He clears his throat, regaining some of his bluster, but there’s a new undertone of sincerity)
Very well, Penelope. For you. And for the Worthington legacy. I shall endeavor to be... authentically strategic. Now, about this gala in two weeks... Marcus mentioned "comestibles." I do hope he hasn't booked the entire catering staff of a major metropolitan area for a simple campaign committee meeting.

[Suddenly, the office intercom crackles to life. A tinny, distorted voice, unmistakably MARCUS’s, squawks through.]

MARCUS (V.O.)
(Through intercom, sounding breathless and triumphant)
Sir! Good news! I’ve booked twenty-seven different culinary teams! From artisanal tapas to molecular gastronomy! And I’ve even secured the head chef of the Grandview Heights Social Club itself! He’s agreed to coordinate the entire *campaign of flavors*! We’re going to need a bigger kitchen, sir! Much bigger!

[REGINALD stares at the intercom in horror. His toupee, perhaps sensing the impending chaos, quivers slightly.]

PENELOPE
(Lets out a long, slow sigh, then rolls her eyes heavenward)
You were saying something about "authentic strategy," Dad?

REGINALD
(His jaw drops, his face turning an alarming shade of puce)
Twenty-seven... culinary... teams?! Marcus, you... you have orchestrated a veritable *gastronomic siege*!

[REGINALD slumps into his chair, looking utterly defeated and utterly ridiculous. PENELOPE shakes her head, a hint of a smile playing on her lips, already pulling out her phone. The stage lights begin to dim slowly, leaving REGINALD frozen in a tableau of comedic despair, while PENELOPE is already making calls, ready to mitigate the impending catastrophe.]
