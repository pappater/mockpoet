**ACT 2, SCENE 1**

**SETTING:** The Grand Ballroom of the Grandview Heights Social Club.

The ballroom is exquisitely decorated for the annual gala, but there's a distinct air of frenetic energy. Chandeliers sparkle, but several banners are askew. Tables are set with gleaming silverware, but some floral arrangements appear precariously balanced. A small, elegant stage stands at one end, flanked by velvet curtains. BEATRICE FLUTTERBY, clutching her clipboard, dashes between tables, muttering to herself, her hair slightly askew. MARCUS FUMBLE, attempting to look professional, adjusts a non-existent tie, his hands full with a pile of papers and a slightly deflated balloon animal.

The room is already buzzing with the murmur of early arrivals. VAL SHARP, dressed in her caterer's uniform, tries to blend into the background, meticulously arranging canapés while frantically scribbling on her hidden notepad. CHESTER BLUFF, now sporting a luxuriant, slightly askew handlebar mustache and a velvet jacket, beams, holding court with a small group of admiring club members, his accent a flamboyant blend of Italian and something vaguely Bavarian. He catches Val's eye and offers a conspiratorial wink. Val glares back.

**(SCENE OPENS)**

BEATRICE
(To herself, ticking off her clipboard)
Chandelier check. One. Two... where's the third? Oh, for heaven's sake! Linens, perfect. Place settings, seventy-two... no, seventy-three. Did we lose a guest? Or gain a ghost?

MARCUS
(Tripping slightly over a tablecloth, nearly sending a vase crashing)
Ah, Beatrice! Just ensuring optimal visual ergonomics for the pre-gala ambiance. My balloon sculpture of Reginald's aspirations is almost complete!

BEATRICE
(Without looking)
Marcus, please! Just... stand still. Or better yet, hide the balloon. No one wants to see Reginald’s aspirations in latex form. Especially not when they resemble a startled badger.

MARCUS
(Earnestly)
It’s a majestic eagle of industry! Poised for an ascent! Just needs a little more... *air*.
(He attempts to blow into the deflated balloon, making a pathetic squeak.)

CLAUDIA
(Sweeping in, impeccably dressed, her tiny dog, PRECIOUS, clutched in her purse. She stops dead, eyeing Marcus's balloon with disdain)
Marcus, darling. Is that quite... *chic*? One expects a certain gravitas at the Grandview Heights. Not a children's birthday party.

MARCUS
(Wilting)
It was for the presidential campaign, Ms. Uppington! A visual mnemonic!

CLAUDIA
(Scoffs, adjusting Precious's miniature diamante collar)
A visual *catastrophe*, more like. Never mind. There are far more pressing matters. Have you heard the *dreadful* gossip?

MARCUS
(Eyes wide)
Gossip? Is it about the new artisanal cheese board? I heard it's quite... *disruptive*.

CLAUDIA
(Airily, fanning herself with a decorative menu)
No, darling, far more titillating! The *Count*! Our dear Count von Geldberg! And... a caterer!

**(Claudia glances pointedly at Val, who freezes, a canapé halfway to a tray.)**

VAL
(Muttering under her breath)
Oh, for the love of...

CHESTER
(Gliding over, a practiced smile plastered on his face, taking Val's arm with an exaggerated flourish)
Ah, my dearest *fidanzata*! You must forgive her; she is quite the perfectionist when it comes to the prosciutto-wrapped fig. Such passion!

CLAUDIA
(Raises an eyebrow, her gaze sweeping over Val's uniform)
Indeed. A caterer. So... *unexpected*. But then, the European aristocracy do have a penchant for... *unconventional* pairings. It adds a certain *je ne sais quoi* to the gene pool.

VAL
(Forcing a smile, digging her heel into Chester's foot)
Thank you, Ms. Uppington. It’s... quite a whirlwind.

CHESTER
(Wincing, but maintains his grin)
A whirlwind of *amoré*! Like a Tuscan tornado! She swept me off my sensible, handcrafted Italian loafers!

CLAUDIA
(Ignoring Val's discomfort)
Well, congratulations, Count! This certainly adds a certain *frisson* to the gala. A new couple to celebrate! And what better occasion than Reginald's bid for club presidency? This will certainly distract from *that* little spectacle.

VAL
(Aside, through gritted teeth, to Chester)
You did this. You *are* the Tuscan tornado.

CHESTER
(Whispering back, pinching her arm playfully)
*Mio tesoro*, play along. It’s for the exposé! Remember? Undercover! Secret mission!
(He winks, his mustache threatening to peel off.)

REGINALD
(Entering grandly, adjusting his slightly askew toupee, looking vaguely panicked yet trying to exude confidence. He spots Chester and Val.)
Count! My dear fellow! And... my goodness! Is it true? The whispers? The rumors are abuzz like a hive of socialized bees!

CHESTER
(Beaming, pulling Val closer)
Indeed, Reginald! My heart, once a lonely Alpine peak, has found its picturesque valley! Allow me to present my fiancée, Miss... ah... Valentina! My little *gnocchetti*!

VAL
(Eyes narrowing at "gnocchetti")
Valerie. It's Valerie.

REGINALD
(Squinting, then waving a dismissive hand)
Valerie, Valentina, a rose by any other name, etcetera. The point is, you’re... *betrothed*! This is simply… *splendid*! A testament to the power of... *inter-club* relations!

CLAUDIA
(Smiling thinly)
Or simply the Count’s impeccable taste in... *refreshments*.

REGINALD
(Not picking up on the sarcasm)
Precisely! Such good fortune! And timing! Just before the presidential vote! It solidifies our alliance, Count! A man of your... *pedigree*... supporting my candidacy!

CHESTER
(Puffing out his chest)
My dear Reginald, my support is as steadfast as the Alps! And as *expensive*! Which brings me to the topic of my beloved Valentina here. Such a practical woman! She worries about the... *fiscal intricacies* of our nuptials.

VAL
(Eyes wide, startled)
I do?

REGINALD
(Clapping Chester on the back, nearly dislodging his mustache)
Nonsense! A wedding for the esteemed Count and his charming fiancée? A mere bagatelle! Consider it a... *campaign expense*! Yes! Pinnacle Solutions will cover the entire affair! A wedding gift from my humble establishment!

VAL
(Choking on air)
Excuse me?!

CHESTER
(Grinning, giving Val's hand a squeeze that feels more like a vise-grip)
My dearest Reginald, you are too generous! A true titan of... *hospitality*! Valentina, my little *strudel*, do you hear? Our dreams are coming true!

VAL
(Pulling her hand away, massaging it surreptitiously)
I think I just dreamt of a rather expensive nightmare.

CLAUDIA
(Chuckling, a cold, calculated sound)
Oh, Reginald, always so *ostentatious*. But a grand gesture, nonetheless. One must ensure the Count feels... *valued*. Perhaps a gift for Precious too? A tiny tiara, perhaps?

REGINALD
(Waving vaguely)
Certainly, certainly. Now, Count, about the speech. Marcus has been diligently compiling my... *campaign oration*. We need to ensure it resonates with the... *hoi polloi* of the club membership.

**(Marcus, carrying a stack of papers, stumbles forward, nearly colliding with a candelabra.)**

MARCUS
Ahem! Yes, Reginald! I've curated a truly *impactful* discourse. It encompasses your vision for...
(He fumbles with the papers.)
...for the Grandview Heights Club's future! And, ah, its *culinary innovations*!

VAL
(Scribbling furiously on her notepad)
"Culinary innovations"? Is he writing a menu?

CHESTER
(Whispering to Val)
*Presto*, *presto*! This is magnificent! A free wedding! We must decide on a honeymoon destination! I’ve always fancied a charming little *château* in... Liechtenstein!

VAL
(Slapping his arm)
There will be no honeymoon! And no wedding! And certainly no Liechtenstein! This is madness! I’m a journalist! I’m here to expose fraud, not marry it!

PENELOPE
(Entering with a sigh that seems to carry the weight of the world, dressed in smart, understated attire. She rolls her eyes at the general scene.)
Honestly, Father, is this really necessary? Another spectacle?

REGINALD
(Turning, flustered)
Penelope! My dear girl! What a... *providential* appearance! Just in time to witness true club camaraderie! The Count and his new fiancée, Miss... Valentina!

PENELOPE
(Peers at Val, then at Chester, then at Val again, her expression unimpressed)
Val. Right. And you’re... in a caterer’s uniform. This is certainly a new level of performance art, Father. Or have you finally diversified into wedding planning for the proletariat?

VAL
(A sudden spark of recognition in her eyes as she notices Penelope's exasperated look)
Actually, I’m just... observing the social ecosystem.

PENELOPE
(Nodding slowly, a hint of a smile playing on her lips)
Ah. The "social ecosystem." A rather *fertile* ground for observation, wouldn't you say? Especially when certain... *specimens*... are trying to climb to the top of the food chain.

CHESTER
(Beaming, oblivious)
Precisely! She's fascinated by the *natural habitat* of the elite! My little *borscht*!

VAL
(Shoots Chester a death glare, then locks eyes with Penelope)
Some might say I’m documenting the... *behavioral patterns* of the indigenous species. Including the invasive ones.
(She gestures subtly towards Chester.)

PENELOPE
(Raises an eyebrow, a knowing glint in her eyes)
Indeed. And some might say that certain indigenous species are prone to... *shedding their skin*... in pursuit of a higher rung on the social ladder. My father, for instance.

REGINALD
(Puffing out his chest)
Nonsense, Penelope! I am merely demonstrating the true spirit of... *electoral camaraderie*! And my commitment to supporting future generations of... *inter-club* unions!
(He gestures grandly to Val and Chester.)

PENELOPE
(Scoffs quietly)
"Inter-club unions." Or rather, an alliance of convenience. Look, Val, I couldn't help but notice...
(She subtly points to Val’s apron pocket, where the corner of her notepad is peeking out, revealing the word "Exposé" in her hurried handwriting.)

VAL
(Gasps, quickly tucking it further in)
Oh! That's just... my grocery list! For... very specific ingredients!

PENELOPE
(Skeptically)
"Exposé: The Art of the Grandview Heights Hustle"? That's a rather dramatic shopping list.

VAL
(Hesitantly)
Look, Penelope, it's... complicated. This whole "engagement" thing, it’s not real. He’s a con artist. I’m just trying to get enough evidence to write a piece on him and... well, everything else.

PENELOPE
(A wry smile)
A con artist, you say? And you're documenting it? My, my. The apple doesn't fall far from the... *absurd* tree, it seems. My father's whole life is a carefully constructed façade.
(She glances at Reginald, who is now adjusting his toupee vigorously while trying to look important.)

VAL
(Relief flooding her)
You understand! I’m Val Sharp, a journalist. I’m undercover here. And "Count von Geldberg" is actually Chester Bluff, a serial imposter.

PENELOPE
(Nods slowly, a glint of amusement in her eyes)
Chester Bluff, eh? Sounds less like a Count and more like a poker hand. Well, Val Sharp, consider me... cautiously intrigued. My father has spent his entire life chasing titles and recognition, always at the expense of genuine connection. Perhaps you can teach him a lesson.

VAL
(Whispering)
My goal is to expose him, and the club, for what they are. This fake engagement has just made things a thousand times worse. Now Reginald wants to pay for the wedding!

PENELOPE
(Eyes widening slightly)
He wants to *pay* for it? Oh, Father, you truly outdo yourself. Well, this changes things. If you're going to expose him, you'll need an inside man. Or, in this case, an inside woman. What’s your plan?

VAL
(Eyes darting between Chester and Reginald)
I need to get his fake credentials, his travel documents, anything that proves he's a fraud. And then I need to expose the whole rotten system without getting caught.

PENELOPE
(Nods decisively)
Right. Well, I know where Father keeps his... *important documents*. And I’m quite good at misdirection. Consider it my contribution to... *truth and transparency*. A concept sorely lacking in this institution.

**(Marcus, meanwhile, has finally located the "campaign speech" among his papers. He approaches Reginald, who is now trying to impress a small cluster of club members with a detailed, yet entirely fabricated, story about his yacht.)**

MARCUS
Reginald! Sir! The speech! It's ready for final review! A truly *potent* piece of prose!

REGINALD
(Waving him off impatiently)
Not now, Marcus! I'm recounting my harrowing escape from a rogue wave off the coast of... Monaco! Very dramatic! Almost lost my entire... *portfolio*!

MARCUS
(Persistently)
But the *oratory impact*! I've juxtaposed your vision for fiscal growth with a compelling narrative about...
(He shuffles the papers, looking confused.)
...the delicate art of poaching a chicken in red wine.

REGINALD
(Finally turning, exasperated)
Poaching a what now, Marcus?!

MARCUS
(Beaming, holding up a page)
The coq au vin! A classic! It represents the careful preparation, the slow-burning passion, the... *enrichment* of flavor over time! A perfect metaphor for the Grandview Heights Club's financial strategy!

REGINALD
(Snatching the papers, bewildered)
Coq au vin? Marcus, this is a speech for the club presidency, not a culinary demonstration! What is this?!
(He flips through the pages, his face turning a shade of purple. The papers are clearly a detailed recipe, complete with cooking times and ingredient lists.)
"Reduce the demi-glace until slightly thickened..." What in the name of... *gastronomy*... is this?!

MARCUS
(Helpfully)
It’s a recipe, Reginald! For the coq au vin! I thought you wanted a *robust* opening! Something to whet their... *appetite*... for leadership! I also prepared a visual aid!
(He holds up a pristine, uncooked chicken leg, which he pulls from his briefcase. It is wrapped in a plastic bag.)

**(The small cluster of club members around Reginald gasps, recoiling from the raw chicken.)**

CLAUDIA
(Sniffs disdainfully)
Raw poultry? Really, Reginald? Is this your idea of a campaign stunt?

REGINALD
(Frantically trying to hide the chicken leg behind his back)
No! Absolutely not! Marcus, you imbecile! This is not part of the... *rhetorical strategy*!

MARCUS
(Looking genuinely hurt)
But you said to focus on the *core ingredients* of your success! And that food always brings people together!

**(Beatrice, passing by, spots the chicken and nearly faints.)**

BEATRICE
(Shrieks)
A health code violation! On gala night! Marcus! Put that bird away! We have seventy-three place settings to worry about, not a salmonella outbreak!

CHESTER
(Sees the chaos, winks at Val)
Ah, the scent of fresh ingredients! And escalating absurdity! *Magnifico*!

VAL
(To Penelope, with wide eyes)
This is going to be easier than I thought. Or much, much worse.
(She pulls out her notepad again, scribbling furiously.)

PENELOPE
(Shakes her head, a small, genuine laugh escaping her)
Either way, Val, it’s never dull. Welcome to the Grandview Heights Social Club.

**(Reginald continues to scold Marcus, the raw chicken leg still awkwardly clutched in his hand. Claudia rolls her eyes, cuddling Precious. Chester beams, his mustache twitching. Val and Penelope share a determined glance, a secret alliance forged amidst the chaos. The buzz in the ballroom grows louder as more guests arrive, eager for the evening's "entertainment," oblivious to the culinary and marital disasters brewing.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**
