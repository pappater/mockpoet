## ACT 3, SCENE 2

**SETTING:** The Grand Ballroom of Grandview Heights Social Club.

*The ballroom is a scene of disarray. Tables are askew, some decorations hang limply, champagne flutes lie shattered. A faint smell of burnt toast (and possibly singed toupee) lingers. BEATRICE FLUTTERBY stands center stage, looking utterly defeated, her clipboard now a mere accessory to her despair. Scattered CLUB MEMBERS, still slightly disheveled and coughing, are murmuring angrily, some wiping soot from their expensive attire. They look towards the entrance expectantly as REGINALD, CLAUDIA, MARCUS, VAL, CHESTER, FREDDY, and PENELOPE gingerly re-enter.*

CLUB MEMBER 1
(To another, loudly)
Burnt toast, you say? My cashmere is irrevocably sullied by the stench of cheap carbohydrates!

CLUB MEMBER 2
(Fanning herself with a napkin)
And my pearls! I believe they've absorbed the trauma. They feel… less lustrous.

*CLAUDIA strides in, holding FIFI aloft like a small, disgruntled sacrifice. Her perfectly coiffed hair is now slightly flattened on one side, a testament to her hasty exit. REGINALD follows, looking deeply self-conscious, his bald head gleaming under the chandeliers. He keeps instinctively reaching for his non-existent toupee.*

REGINALD
(Voice strained)
My dear friends, esteemed colleagues… I trust this minor conflagration has not… singed your spirit of conviviality!

*He tries a grandiose gesture, but his hand flies to his head, a habit he can't break.*

CLAUDIA
(To the room, dramatically)
A catastrophe! A complete and utter social implosion! My Fifi, traumatized! My evening, in tatters! And my reputation… oh, my reputation!

*FIFI, nestled in Claudia’s arms, lets out a small, nervous whimper.*

MARCUS
(Enthusiastically, to no one in particular)
Ah, the grand re-entry! Post-modern catharsis! The Phoenix rising from the ashes of… burnt toast! Truly, an unparalleled piece of meta-narrative. I knew the false alarm was merely a theatrical device.

*He beams, clearly thinking he's figured everything out.*

CLUB MEMBER 3
(Stepping forward, indignantly)
Meta-narrative? We demand an explanation, Mr. Worthington! And you, Madam Uppington! What exactly *was* that performance? And who is this… this *waiter* who declared himself a billionaire?

*She points an accusatory finger at FREDDY, who has entered quietly, looking perfectly at ease amidst the chaos.*

FREDDY
(A wry smile)
Frederick Montague, at your service. And yes, I simply enjoy a good show.

CLUB MEMBER 4
(Eyes wide)
The Montague?! Of Montague Global Industries?! But… you were clearing plates!

FREDDY
A man has to eat, doesn't he? And observe. The social ecosystem is fascinating, wouldn't you agree?

PENELOPE
(Stepping forward, a dry smirk)
And speaking of observations, perhaps we should acknowledge the elephant in the ballroom, or rather, the Count in the… rather ill-fitting suit.

*All eyes turn to CHESTER, who enters with a flourish, having quickly adjusted a new, ridiculously oversized fake mustache. He bows deeply, an exaggerated theatrical gesture.*

CHESTER
(A flamboyant, unplaceable accent – perhaps a mix of Spanish, Russian, and something vaguely Scottish)
Ah, the moment of truth! Or, as we say in the old country, "Cuando el gato sale del saco, los ratones bailan flamenco con caviar!" Which roughly translates to: "When the cat's out of the bag, the mice dance flamenco with caviar!"

REGINALD
(Stammering, pointing at Chester)
You… you fiend! You charlatan! Impersonating a Count! Advising me on… on aristocratic etiquette! I nearly proposed a duel!

CLAUDIA
(Shaking Fifi at Chester)
And my ancestral lineage! You fabricated a whole Balkan dynasty! I almost bought a small vineyard in… where was it, "Bluffington-on-Sea"?

CHESTER
(Chuckles)
A small creative liberty, dear Madame. But I merely held a mirror, did I not? To the… *aspirations* of the esteemed company. One man's con is another man's… carefully curated personal brand.

VAL
(Stepping forward, notebook still in hand, but now openly)
Or another woman's exposé.

*She makes eye contact with Chester, a shared spark of mischief and respect.*

PENELOPE
(To her father, gently but firmly)
Dad. They're demanding answers. And for once, maybe… honest ones.

*Reginald looks at Penelope, then at the expectant faces of the club members, then instinctively pats his bare scalp. He sighs, deflating slightly.*

REGINALD
(Clears throat, attempts to recapture dignity, fails)
Yes. Answers. My good friends, what you have witnessed tonight… has been a crucible. A trial by fire… and burnt toast.

*He winces. He spots a discarded cocktail napkin, picks it up, and stares at it as if it holds the meaning of life. This is the moment he's supposed to give his genuine speech.*

REGINALD (CONT'D)
(Reading from the napkin, a faint smudge of Val's earlier exposé notes still visible)
"The hollow pretensions of the elite… the desperate scramble for validation… a pathetic performance…"

*He pauses, looks up, bewildered, then looks back at the napkin, recognizing his own accidental speech from earlier.*

REGINALD (CONT'D)
(A deep breath, a flicker of vulnerability in his eyes)
Actually… actually, that was rather well put. By… well, by someone. And frankly, it's… it's true.

*The room falls silent. Claudia’s jaw drops. Marcus looks on, utterly absorbed.*

REGINALD (CONT'D)
(Voice softer, almost entirely losing his pompous tone)
I… I wanted to be President of this club because… because I needed to be *seen*. To be admired. To prove that Reginald Worthington III was… was worthy. Worthy of the name. Worthy of the… the toupee.

*He gestures to his head, a genuine self-deprecating laugh escaping him.*

REGINALD (CONT'D)
(Sighs)
I’m… I’m terrified, you see. That underneath all the bluster and the… the executive offices… I'm just… Reginald. And maybe… maybe that’s not enough.

*He looks at Penelope, a silent plea for understanding. She offers a small, genuine smile.*

CLUB MEMBER 1
(Whispering)
Good heavens. He's… honest.

CLUB MEMBER 5
(Whispering back)
It's unnerving. Like seeing a peacock without its tail.

CLAUDIA
(Eyes narrowing, sensing a shift in the room's dynamic, pulling herself together. She can't let Reginald win the "honesty" contest.)
Nonsense, Reginald! You’re magnificent! A titan! A… a slightly balding titan! But honesty! Yes! That's it! Transparency!

*She pushes Fifi into Marcus's arms, who awkwardly cradles the dog.*

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
(Placing a hand over her heart, dramatically)
I, too, have a confession! A profound admission of… of humanity! My relentless pursuit of social standing, my tireless efforts to curate the perfect persona… it was all for *you*, dear club members! For the greater good! To elevate our standards! To ensure our soirées were… *impeccable!*

*She pauses, expecting applause. Silence. Fifi lets out a small, disgusted bark from Marcus's arms.*

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
(Quickly, changing tack)
And yes, perhaps I was a *tiny* bit manipulative! Perhaps I did spread a *few* rumors about Reginald's… *questionable* antique collection! But it was all in the spirit of… competitive philanthropy! Don’t we all want the best for our precious Grandview Heights Social Club?

*She gives a saccharine smile, which slowly slips as no one responds.*

MARCUS
(To Fifi, stroking her gently)
She's performing the "competitive philanthropy" monologue now, Fifi. It’s a bold choice, but the subtext is muddled.

CLUB MEMBER 2
(Dryly)
Indeed. More muddled than my pearls.

CHESTER
(Stepping forward, grandly, with another dramatic shift in accent – perhaps a French flourish this time)
Ah, *mes amis*! To confess is human, to perform, divine! I, too, shall lay bare my soul! I am no Count. My name is Chester Bluff. And yes, I am a con artist! *Voila!*

*He throws his hands up in a gesture of proud surrender.*

CHESTER (CONT'D)
But tell me, truly! Am I the only one who has performed tonight? Look around! Reginald, with his magnificent toupee and equally magnificent delusions! Claudia, with her perfectly coiffed image and her perfectly trained canine accessory! Each of you, meticulously polishing your social armor, adjusting your masks, perfecting your grand pronouncements! I merely provided the plot twist! The catalyst! The… *scandale!*

*He winks at Val.*

VAL
(Stepping forward, a genuine smile)
He's not entirely wrong. I came here, quite frankly, to mock you. To expose the absurdity, the hypocrisy. And yes, for a good headline. Valentina Sharp, Truth and Consequences Media. That's my real identity, by the way.

*A collective gasp from the club members.*

VAL (CONT'D)
(Looking around, a slight softening in her voice)
But what I found… was more than just a story. It was… a lot of people trying really hard. Trying to belong. Trying to be enough. And in the process, tripping over each other, over their own ambition, over their own ridiculousness. It’s… surprisingly human. Even when it’s utterly farcical.

*She looks at Chester, then at Penelope, a shared understanding passing between them.*

FREDDY
(Calmly, stepping into the center, his presence radiating an unexpected authority)
So. We've had our confessions. Our performances. Our revelations. Perhaps now, we can simply stop.

*Everyone looks at him.*

FREDDY (CONT'D)
Stop pretending. Stop trying so hard. Just… be. It’s far less exhausting. And frankly, more interesting.

REGINALD
(Rubbing his bald head thoughtfully)
"Just… be." Hmm. Revolutionary. And… cheaper.

CLAUDIA
(Snapping her fingers)
Freddy’s right! Being authentic! It’s the new bespoke! The ultimate luxury brand! I knew it! I was always at the vanguard of authenticity! Fifi, darling, we’re going to be trendsetters!

*Fifi sighs dramatically in Marcus's arms.*

MARCUS
(Suddenly, his eyes wide with a new epiphany)
Wait! So, the confessions… the drama… the existential angst… it’s all been building to the *authenticity reveal*? A pre-emptive strike against future performance anxiety! Brilliant! Truly groundbreaking meta-theatre! Does this mean the coq au vin is still cancelled? Or is the authenticity reveal *also* a metaphor for the coq au vin?

*He looks around, deeply earnest, clutching Fifi as if she holds the answer to the universe's most profound culinary mysteries.*

BEATRICE
(From her position of utter defeat, a small, pained moan)
The coq au vin… the menus… the fire inspection… my life…

*She collapses onto a nearby chair, clipboard scattering its pages across the floor like autumn leaves.*

REGINALD
(Looking at Beatrice, a flicker of genuine concern)
Beatrice, are you quite all right?

CLAUDIA
(Brushing off her dress)
Oh, she’s merely embodying the trauma of the evening. Very method, Beatrice.

CHESTER
(To Val, quietly, with a charming grin)
Perhaps, *ma chérie*, our next act can be a more… genuine partnership.

VAL
(A smirk)
Still writing the script, Chester?

CHESTER
(Waving a hand grandly)
The stage is always set, *mon petit chou*. The audience, ever hungry for a spectacle.

*Suddenly, a loud, insistent buzzing sound cuts through the air. Everyone jumps.*

CLUB MEMBER 3
(Startled)
What in the…?!

*Reginald spots a small, forgotten remote control on a side table. He picks it up, baffled. He presses a button. The buzzing stops. He presses it again, and a small, mechanical voice crackles from a hidden speaker near the ceiling.*

MECHANICAL VOICE
(Tinny, distorted)
…Attention, esteemed members! Due to unforeseen… *combustive events*… the Presidential Vote for the Grandview Heights Social Club will now resume. Please proceed to the designated voting booths. Your future… awaits!

*The voice crackles off. Everyone stands frozen, bewildered.*

REGINALD
(Holding the remote, utterly perplexed)
The vote… now? But… after all that…

CLAUDIA
(Snapping out of it, a manic glint in her eye)
The vote! Of course! The final act! The ultimate demonstration of… authentic leadership!

*She snatches Fifi from Marcus, who looks forlorn.*

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
(To the room, a desperate rallying cry)
Let’s show them, my darlings! Let's cast our votes for… for integrity! For vision! For a canine-friendly environment!

*She hurries off towards the voting area, pulling a bewildered Fifi along.*

REGINALD
(Dropping the remote, frantically patting his bald head again)
But… but my toupee! I can’t vote without my… my presidential adornment! It's tradition! It’s… it's me!

PENELOPE
(Taking his arm, a sympathetic but firm grip)
Dad. It’s just you. And that’s actually… okay.

*She guides him towards the voting area. Marcus, looking lost, picks up Beatrice’s scattered clipboard pages.*

MARCUS
(To himself, reading from a page with a frantic doodle of a dog)
"Final check on structural integrity… ensure no further dog-related incidents…" This performance has layers I hadn't even considered.

*He shuffles off after Reginald and Penelope. Chester winks at Val, then makes a show of straightening his fake mustache and suavely following the others. Val shakes her head, a thoughtful smile playing on her lips, before following.*

FREDDY
(To Beatrice, who is still slumped on the chair amidst the scattered papers)
Are you coming, Beatrice? The show isn't over yet.

BEATRICE
(Muttering, barely audible)
Oh, it’s never over, is it? Never… over.

*She slowly begins to gather her papers, muttering about the structural integrity of toast as the mechanical voice crackles once more, a faint, garbled message about "democratic participation" and "canapés."*

*FADE TO BLACK.*
