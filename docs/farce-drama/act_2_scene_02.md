## ACT 2, SCENE 2

**SETTING:** The VIP Lounge of the Grandview Heights Social Club. It’s an opulent but slightly claustrophobic room, filled with plush velvet seating, polished mahogany tables, and strategically placed potted palms. Several discreet doors lead off to other areas of the club. A small, elegant bar is set up at one end. Servers are circulating with trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The atmosphere is one of forced joviality and thinly veiled social jockeying.

**(AT RISE):**

FREDDY, dressed in a rather ill-fitting server's vest over his casual but expensive clothes, deftly navigates the room with a tray of champagne flutes. He looks utterly calm, almost enjoying himself. BEATRICE hovers nearby, clipboard clutched to her chest, looking harried.

BEATRICE
(Muttering to herself, frantically checking her clipboard)
...Mini quiches, petit fours, canapés... oh, the horror, the hummus is late! It's *always* the hummus! Freddy, darling, are you sure you can manage the bar *and* the circulating? One man, so much potential for... for *disaster*!

FREDDY
(Calmly, refilling a glass)
Quite sure, Beatrice. I find the key is not to rush. And to anticipate thirst. Like a particularly elegant, human wellspring.

BEATRICE
(Waving a hand dismissively)
Yes, yes, quite. Just... don't talk to the members too much. They prefer their servers to be seen and not... *heard*, if you catch my drift. Now, where is that blasted truffle oil for the mushroom caps? This evening simply *must* be flawless. For Reginald's sake, and my sanity!

**(CLAUDIA UPPINGTON sweeps in, followed by a handful of sycophantic club members. She spots FREDDY and imperiously snaps her fingers.)**

CLAUDIA
You! Server! Over here, immediately. This champagne is lukewarm. And don't tell me it's "room temperature," darling, I know the difference between room temperature and tepid *swill*.

FREDDY
(Approaching with a placid smile)
My apologies, Madam Uppington. Allow me to procure a fresher vintage. Perhaps a chilled rosé? It has a delightful bouquet this season, reminiscent of... well, a very expensive bouquet.

CLAUDIA
(Eyeing him suspiciously)
Rosé? In *my* VIP Lounge? Good heavens, are you suggesting I'm having a picnic? Just bring me something *properly* chilled and don't make conversation. Service, not a philosophy seminar. Honestly, Beatrice, where do you *find* these people?

BEATRICE
(Flustered, rushing over)
Oh, Claudia, darling! So glad you could make it! Freddy is... well, Freddy is very *enthusiastic*! Just helping out. You know, staff shortages, the general malaise of the modern workforce...

CLAUDIA
(Waving Beatrice away)
Spare me the socioeconomic woes. Just ensure my glass remains full and frosty. And tell your "enthusiastic helper" to wipe that knowing smirk off his face. It's dreadfully unprofessional.

**(FREDDY simply gives a subtle, knowing smile, turns, and heads to the bar. CLAUDIA turns to her entourage, lowering her voice conspiratorially.)**

CLAUDIA
And did you hear about the Count von Geldberg? He's engaged! To a *caterer*! Can you imagine? What next, the head chef's niece running for presidency? The club is going utterly to the dogs. Though I must admit, Reginald's sudden affinity for foreign nobility is... *intriguing*. Perhaps a strategic alliance for his presidential bid?

**(REGINALD WORTHINGTON III enters, smoothing down his suit, but more importantly, patting his toupee with increasing frequency. He beams a wide, slightly manic smile.)**

REGINALD
(Booming)
My dear Claudia! And my esteemed colleagues! What a perfectly *prodigious* evening, wouldn't you agree? The air fairly *vibrates* with anticipation! And opportunity!

CLAUDIA
(Coolly)
Reginald. Your toupee appears to be performing a subtle yet distinct flamenco. Are you quite alright? One wouldn't want it to... *ascend* during the crucial voting.

REGINALD
(Jumping, hands flying to his head, adjusting the toupee aggressively)
My toupee? Nonsense, Claudia! It's perfectly... *affixed*! Just a minor adjustment for optimal aerodynamic *prowess*! A gentleman must always be prepared for any gust of... *gravitas*! Ah, my dear Count!

**(CHESTER BLUFF, as "Count von Geldberg," enters, arm-in-arm with VAL. CHESTER is resplendent in an overly elaborate, slightly ill-fitting suit, his fake mustache now a rather impressive handlebar. VAL looks increasingly uncomfortable, trying to juggle a tray of canapés and her hidden notepad.)**

CHESTER
(His accent a peculiar blend of German and a newly acquired, thicker Russian, delivered with dramatic flourish)
Ah, Reginald, mein Freund! And Madam Uppington, so *ravishing*! My little *Svetlana* here is still a-tremble with the news of our engagement! Such *magnificent* gesture from you, Reginald, to sponsor our modest nuptials! Pinnacle Solutions – a pillar of patronage!

VAL
(Through gritted teeth, balancing her tray precariously)
It's Val, Count. And I'm not trembling, I'm... experiencing a slight occupational tremor from balancing these incredibly delicate salmon canapés.

CHESTER
(Patting her hand dramatically)
See, my little borscht-blossom? She is so *humble*! Always thinking of the fishies!

**(A Club Member, MRS. WIDGETT, a bird-like woman with too much jewellery, approaches CHESTER excitedly.)**

MRS. WIDGETT
Count von Geldberg! My dear husband and I were just discussing your fascinating heritage! Tell us, what is your ancestral estate like? Is it true you have a castle carved entirely from... *edam cheese*?

CHESTER
(Caught off guard, he blinks, his accent wavering towards a distinctly Scottish brogue)
Edam cheese, you say? Ah, a common misconception, dear Mrs. Widgett! A delightful *misunderstanding*! No, no, my ancestral seat, 'Bluff-on-the-Hill', is made entirely of... solid *granite*! Very... *granitic*! And quite drafty!

MRS. WIDGETT
(Confused)
Bluff-on-the-Hill? I thought you were from Geldberg? And your accent... it sounds like my plumber.

CHESTER
(Quickly shifting to a smooth French)
Ah, *ma chère*, the complexities of a multi-hyphenated noble lineage! Geldberg is the region, Bluff-on-the-Hill is the *château*! And my accent? It is merely the delightful reverberation of my extensive travels! I have a touch of the *joie de vivre*, you see, which manifests in my vocal *timbre*!

REGINALD
(Clapping CHESTER on the back, causing his toupee to tilt precariously)
Exactly! The Count is a man of the world, Mrs. Widgett! A true globalist! Exactly the kind of man who understands... *intercontinental commerce*! And how to secure a decisive victory in a club election!

**(Reginald's toupee has now slipped almost entirely over his right eye. He is unaware.)**

VAL
(Trying to jot something down on her notepad, hidden beneath a napkin on her tray)
(*Muttering to herself*) "Count Bluff, now Scottish-French, claims granite castle, formerly cheese." This is pure gold.

**(CLAUDIA approaches, eying CHESTER with suspicion.)**

CLAUDIA
Count, darling, tell us more about Geldberg. I’ve always been fascinated by the, ah, *Carpathian* region. Do they have many... *truffle pig* farms? I’m looking to diversify my portfolio.

CHESTER
(Suddenly adopting a thick, almost comical Italian accent, gesturing wildly)
Ah, the truffa pig! A magnificent creature, Madam Uppington! My family, they have many of these *squisito* animals! They dig the truffles, yes? With their little noses! Very... *rustic*! We call them the *porcellino dei tartufi*!

VAL
(Stifling a laugh, she almost drops a canapé. She tries to write, but the notepad slips, revealing a corner.)
(*To herself*) "Truffle pigs now Italian." This is getting out of hand.

BEATRICE
(Spotting Val’s notepad)
Miss Sharp! Is that... is that a shopping list? You’re on duty! No personal effects on the serving tray! And your skirt is... slightly askew! Goodness gracious, the presentation!

VAL
(Quickly shoving the notepad back under the napkin)
No, Beatrice! Just... recipe ideas! For, uh, *new canapés*! Very innovative!

CLAUDIA
(Dismissively)
Leave the caterer to her culinary imaginings, Beatrice. Count, I must say, your passion for... *swine* is quite unexpected. One usually associates nobility with, well, *less earthy* pursuits.

CHESTER
(Waving his hand, his accent now morphing into a vague, aristocratic English)
Oh, but my dear Lady Claudia, it is precisely this connection to the *terra firma* that gives our ancient lineage its strength! We are grounded, you see! Unlike some who merely float... *above it all*!

**(He casts a pointed look at REGINALD, whose toupee has now slid further, completely covering his right eye like an elaborate pirate patch. He attempts to sip his champagne, missing his mouth slightly.)**

REGINARD
(Eyes squinting, trying to see past his toupee)
Quite! Grounded! Like a sturdy oak! Ready to provide a strong *foundation* for the club’s future! And to outmaneuver any... *underhanded foliage*!

**(PENELOPE PRIM enters, observing the scene with a dry, exasperated look. She catches Val's eye and gives a subtle, knowing wink.)**

PENELOPE
(Quietly, to Val, as she takes a glass of champagne from FREDDY)
My father's toupee seems to be having a crisis of identity tonight. Much like his "Count" here. You're doing splendidly, by the way. I almost believed the truffle pig story.

VAL
(Whispering back, trying to maintain her server persona)
Penelope! He's running out of countries. And I’m running out of discreet places to write.

FREDDY
(Handing Penelope the champagne, a wry smile playing on his lips)
The Count's geographical agility is truly something to behold. Perhaps he could join the Olympic cartography team.

CLAUDIA
(Overhearing Freddy)
You! Server! Less chitchat with the... the help! And bring me another one of those exquisite miniature quiches. The ones that don't taste like regret.

FREDDY
(To Claudia)
As you command, Madam Uppington. Though I assure you, regret is rarely found in our catering. More often, it’s a side dish served with ambition.

CLAUDIA
(Snapping)
Are you quite finished with your insolence?

FREDDY
(Bowing slightly)
For now, madam.

**(FREDDY retreats, amused. Reginald is still struggling with his toupee, now trying to surreptitiously push it back with his champagne glass, which leads to a small spill down his suit front.)**

REGINALD
(Spluttering)
Confound these bubbles! They've... they've *perforated* my waistcoat! A most unseemly stain!

CHESTER
(To Val, his voice now a low, conspiratorial whisper, his accent indeterminable but clearly urgent)
Val, my little *mon chou*! They are asking too many questions! My identity, it is like a chameleon with attention deficit! You must distract them! Perhaps with a tray of those delightful... *pigs in blankets*!

VAL
(Whispering back, exasperated)
I'm a caterer, not a circus act! And I think you’ve already covered the pig angle!

**(Suddenly, another Club Member, MR. FINCH, a portly man, approaches CHESTER.)**

MR. FINCH
Count! I've just returned from my holiday in Lugano, and I simply *must* ask you about the annual... the annual *Geldberg Cheese Rolling Festival*! Is it still as dangerous as they say? My cousin broke an ankle!

CHESTER
(Eyes wide, completely flummoxed, his accent a frantic mix of everything)
The... the Cheese Rolling! Ah, yes! A brutal sport! My country, it is *known* for this! We roll the cheese, yes, down the *schneiden*! With many *oof-dahs* and *sacré bleus*! My cousin, he too broke an ankle! And a *hip*! A family tradition!

VAL
(To Penelope, completely deadpan)
He's making up festivals now.

PENELOPE
(Grinning)
It’s almost poetic. My father’s ambition, Claudia’s snobbery, and now a Swiss-Austrian-French-Italian cheese-rolling count. The club truly is a microcosm of human folly.

**(Beatrice rushes past, clutching her clipboard, nearly bumping into VAL.)**

BEATRICE
Miss Sharp! The truffle oil! It’s gone missing! We're facing a canapé crisis of epic proportions! And the main course is due in five minutes! You simply *must* find it! It’s in a tiny bottle, looks rather like... *perfume*!

VAL
(Staring at Beatrice, then at the chaos)
The truffle oil? But... I have...

**(She glances at her tray, where the hidden notepad is, and then at Reginald, who is now trying to pat his toupee back into place with the entire palm of his hand, making it look like a small, furry beret. Val realizes the tiny bottle of truffle oil is likely mixed up with her belongings in the back. Or perhaps Marcus has it.)**

VAL
(To Beatrice, suddenly determined)
Right! Truffle oil! I'm on it! It's a matter of national security for the canapés!

**(Val quickly hands her tray to Penelope, who takes it with a raised eyebrow. Val quickly grabs a small bottle from her hidden apron pocket. She pulls out her notepad, jots down another quick note, then quickly shoves the truffle oil back in, and dashes off towards a side door.)**

PENELOPE
(Holding the tray, looking at a surprised Club Member)
Canapé? Or perhaps a quick review of the Count's ever-shifting homeland?

REGINALD
(Finally getting his toupee somewhat straightened, though it's clearly backward)
The truffle oil! A vital ingredient for my *impending victory*! My good Count, you must speak more on these... these 'truffa pigs'! They sound very... *pertinent*!

CHESTER
(Grabbing Reginald's arm, his eyes wide and frantic, whispering in an entirely new, heavily Irish brogue)
Reginald, me boyo! We’ve pushed our luck! The cheese rolling was a step too far! I’m running on fumes here! They’ll be askin’ for my birth certificate next! My wee Val has gone for the oil, a perfect distraction, but we need a diversion! A big one!

**(Chester spots CLAUDIA's tiny dog, which has been quietly dozing in her purse, now stirring and peeking out. He gets a mischievous glint in his eye.)**

REGINALD
Diversion? But the gala! The vote! My speech! I need *composure*! And perhaps some more hairspray for this... this *disobedient thatch*!

CLAUDIA
(Adjusting her tiny dog's bow)
My precious Petunia is quite content, unlike some of the service. She rarely causes a fuss.

CHESTER
(Whispering urgently to Reginald, pointing to Petunia, his accent now a hurried mix of everything)
The dog! The little *pupchik*! A delightful, *spontaneous* moment of canine-induced chaos! It will take the heat off the cheese! Trust me, my friend, I am an expert in... *zoological misdirection*!

**(Chester subtly, with a flick of his wrist, nudges CLAUDIA's purse. The tiny clasp gives way. Petunia, suddenly free, stretches, yawns, and then, seeing a fallen canapé near Reginald's feet, springs out of the purse with surprising agility.)**

CLAUDIA
(Gasps dramatically)
Petunia! My little darling!

REGINALD
(Jumps, startled by the tiny dog, which snatches the canapé from his shoe. His toupee flies off completely, landing with a soft thud in FREDDY's freshly refilled champagne glass.)
My... my *follicular integrity*!

**(A collective gasp ripples through the room. FREDDY looks calmly at the toupee floating in the champagne. CLAUDIA shrieks about her dog. CHESTER beams with a triumphant, if slightly deranged, smile. PENELOPE shakes her head, amused. The gala music swells slightly as a main door to the ballroom opens, signaling the next stage of the evening.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**
