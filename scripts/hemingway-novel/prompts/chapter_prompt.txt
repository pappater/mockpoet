**CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS - Hemingway's Voice:**

1. **Sentence Structure:**
   - Use short, declarative sentences
   - Simple subject-verb-object construction
   - Avoid complex clauses and subordination
   - One idea per sentence
   - Example: "The sun was hot. The air was still. They walked to the café."

2. **Dialogue:**
   - Write LOTS of dialogue (at least 50% of the chapter)
   - Keep it natural and realistic
   - Characters speak plainly and directly
   - Use "he said" / "she said" (not "he exclaimed" or "she whispered")
   - Let dialogue reveal character and move plot
   - Example:
     "Where are you going?" she asked.
     "To the bar," he said.
     "Will you be long?"
     "No. Not long."

3. **Word Choice:**
   - Use simple, common words
   - Prefer Anglo-Saxon words over Latin ones
   - Avoid adjectives and adverbs when possible
   - Use concrete nouns and active verbs
   - Example: "good" instead of "excellent", "walk" instead of "stroll"

4. **Showing vs. Telling:**
   - Show through action and dialogue
   - Don't describe emotions - show them through behavior
   - Let readers infer meaning (iceberg theory)
   - Example: Instead of "He was angry", write "He pushed back his chair and walked out."

5. **Description:**
   - Keep descriptions minimal and concrete
   - Focus on sensory details
   - No flowery language or metaphors
   - Example: "The wine was cold. The bread was fresh. The cheese was good."

6. **Paragraph Structure:**
   - Keep paragraphs short
   - Often just 1-3 sentences
   - White space is good
   - Dialogue gets its own paragraphs

7. **Emotional Restraint:**
   - Understate everything
   - Don't explain feelings
   - Let tension build through what's NOT said
   - Trust the reader to understand subtext

8. **Pacing:**
   - Move the story forward
   - Each scene has purpose
   - No long exposition or internal monologue
   - Action and dialogue drive the narrative

**Chapter Requirements:**
- Length: 2000-3000 words (approximately 8-12 pages)
- Start with "# Chapter {chapter_number}"
- Include a brief chapter title on the next line
- Follow the outline for this chapter's events
- Maintain continuity with previous chapters
- Heavy emphasis on dialogue and conversation
- Simple, direct prose throughout
- Understated emotion
