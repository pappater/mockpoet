Create a complete outline for a novel titled "{novel_title}" with {total_chapters} chapters.

Theme: {theme}

Use the following series bible as your guide:

{series_bible}

Create a chapter-by-chapter outline that:

1. **Follows Hemingway's narrative structure**:
   - Clear, linear progression
   - Each chapter advances the plot
   - Focus on action and dialogue
   - Minimal exposition
   - Let the story unfold through what characters do and say

2. **Story Arc**:
   - Beginning: Establish characters and situation
   - Middle: Develop conflicts and relationships
   - End: Resolution (can be ambiguous, Hemingway-style)

3. **Chapter Structure**:
   - Each chapter should be 8-12 pages (2000-3000 words)
   - Include key scenes, dialogue moments, revelations
   - Show character development through action
   - Maintain consistent tone and pacing

4. **Hemingway Elements**:
   - Lots of conversation between characters
   - Simple, declarative sentences
   - Focus on concrete details
   - Understated emotion
   - Show, don't tell

For each chapter, provide:
- Chapter number and title
- 2-3 sentence summary of what happens
- Key scenes or dialogue moments
- Character developments
- How it advances the main theme

Write the outline in clear, direct prose. Keep it focused and practical.

Output as a well-structured markdown document with each chapter clearly numbered.
